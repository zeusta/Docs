<h5 id="how-customers-buy-credit-product">How customers buy Credit Product</h5>
<p><img alt="how customers buy credit product" src="../Image_EcommerceManagement/image214.png" /></p>
<p>After customers login to your website, they can access the <strong>Store Credit Products</strong> page in two ways:</p>
<p>•   <strong>Option 1</strong>: on the top navigation bar, click to <strong>Buy Store Credit</strong> </p>
<p>•   <strong>Option 2</strong>: click on the <strong>Store Credit</strong> on the left navigation of the <strong>Account Dashboard</strong> page</p>
<p><strong>Option 1:</strong></p>
<p><img alt=" how customers buy credit product" src="../Image_EcommerceManagement/image216.png" /></p>
<p>After that, the <strong>Store Credit</strong> page will be shown as above.</p>
<p>As you can see, this page lists all <strong>Credit Products</strong> of your website. There are three types of credit products for customers to choose: fixed values, range of values and drop-down values. </p>
<p><img alt=" how customers buy credit product" src="../Image_EcommerceManagement/image218.png" /></p>
<p>•   <strong>Fixed Value</strong>: These credit products have fixed value. </p>
<p><img alt=" how customers buy credit product" src="../Image_EcommerceManagement/image220.png" /></p>
<p>•   <strong>Drop-down Values</strong>: With this type, customers can select a specific value in the drop-down list.</p>
<p><img alt=" how customers buy credit product" src="../Image_EcommerceManagement/image222.png" /></p>
<p>•   <strong>Range of Values</strong>: With this type, customers can choose a desired credit amount within the range configured by admin in backend. </p>
<p><img alt=" how customers buy credit product" src="../Image_EcommerceManagement/image224.png" /></p>
<p>After selecting credit products they like, customers can add them to cart and checkout normally.</p>
<p>When the order is complete, our module will auto-add that credit amount to the customer’s credit balance.</p>
<p><img alt=" how customers buy credit product" src="../Image_EcommerceManagement/image226.png" /></p>
<p>Customers can also send Credits to their friends</p>
<p>1)  Tick <strong>Send credit to friend</strong> checkbox </p>
<p>2)  Enter the name of the recipient </p>
<p>3)  Enter the email address of the recipient. The system will send an email to this address</p>
<p>4)  Enter the message that recipient will receive.</p>
<p><strong>Option 2:</strong></p>
<p>In this second way, they will be navigated to the <strong>My Credit</strong> page on which they just need to click on the <strong>Buy store credit</strong> button. See section <strong>Send Credit to Friends</strong> to see how it works for customers. </p>
<p>When the order is completed, there will be two cases happening based on signup status of the recipient email address. </p>
<p><img alt=" how customers buy credit product" src="../Image_EcommerceManagement/image228.png" /></p>
<p>•   <strong>Case 1</strong>: if the recipient do not have an account in the system, an email as above will be sent.</p>
<p>•   <strong>Case 2</strong>: if the recipient has already had an account in the system, the system will automatically add that credit amount to the Recipient’s credit balance.</p>
<p><img alt=" how customers buy credit product" src="../Image_EcommerceManagement/image230.png" /></p>
<p>In both cases, the sender always gets email notifications as above.</p>
<h5 id="how-customers-manage-credit-on-my-credit-page">How customers manage Credit on My Credit page</h5>
<p>In order to access the <strong>My Credit</strong> page, customers can click on the <strong>Store Credit</strong> tab on the left navigation.</p>
<h6 id="manage-credit-balance">Manage Credit Balance</h6>
<p><img alt="how customers manage credit balance" src="../Image_EcommerceManagement/image232.png" /></p>
<p>On the <strong>My Credit</strong> page, customers can view information about their current credit balances and transaction history.</p>
<p>In the section <strong>Transaction History</strong>, our module shows customers all of their credit transactions with a lot of information including <strong>date, type, details, added/deducted value in transaction</strong> and <strong>credit balance</strong>.</p>
<h6 id="send-credit-to-friends">Send Credit to Friends</h6>
<p><img alt=" how customers send credit to friends" src="../Image_EcommerceManagement/image234.png" /></p>
<p>First, customers should click on the Send Credit tab on the left navigation to go to the <strong>Send Credit to Friends</strong> page as above. </p>
<p>This page has 2 parts including <strong>Send Credit to Friends</strong> and <strong>Credit Code List.</strong></p>
<p>•   <strong>Send Credit to Friends</strong>: allows customers to send credit to their friends by filling in all required information</p>
<p>•   <strong>Credit Code List</strong>: shows all information about the credit codes that customers sent to their friends including <strong>code, recipient’s email, amount, sent date and status of code.</strong> Credit codes are not displayed fully for security purpose. When customers click on, they will be shown clearly.</p>
<p><img alt=" how customers send credit to friends" src="../Image_EcommerceManagement/image236.png" /></p>
<p>Please note that our module allows you to configure whether to require your customers to verify their credit sharing or not. We will consider the two cases separately.</p>
<p><strong>i.</strong>  <strong>Case 1: Customers are not required to verify their credit sharing</strong>.</p>
<p><img alt=" how customers send credit to friends" src="../Image_EcommerceManagement/image238.png" /></p>
<p>1)  Enter recipient’s email</p>
<p>2) Add an amount customers want to send to their friend.</p>
<p>3) Write a message to the recipient. </p>
<p>4) Click on <strong>Send</strong> button
Notice that after entering recipient’s email,  our module will check that email address and show notification to customers.</p>
<p>•   <strong>If the recipient’s email has not been registered on the website</strong>: </p>
<p><img alt=" how customers send credit to friends" src="../Image_EcommerceManagement/image240.png" /></p>
<p>In this case, our module will show a notification for the customer that his friend will receive the credit code via that email. After that, the sender’s credit balance will be deducted immediately and an email will be auto-sent to the recipient’s email address.</p>
<p><img alt=" how customers send credit to friends" src="../Image_EcommerceManagement/image242.png" /></p>
<p>As you can see, this email informs the recipient about the credit amount, message and a credit code which can be used to redeem credit to his balance.</p>
<p><img alt=" how customers send credit to friends" src="../Image_EcommerceManagement/image244.png" /></p>
<p>At the same time, the sender can also see the sent credit code in the <strong>Credit Code List</strong> section as above.</p>
<p>In this section, customers can follow the status of the credit codes they sent. While the recipient has not redeemed a credit code, customers are allowed to cancel it by clicking on the <strong>Cancel</strong> link in the <strong>Action</strong> column. After the cancellation, the recipient cannot redeem that credit code any more.</p>
<p>Otherwise, once the credit code has been redeemed, the status will be updated and the <strong>Cancel</strong> link will be disabled. Please refer to the section   <strong>Redeem Credit</strong> for more information. </p>
<p><img alt=" how customers send credit to friends" src="../Image_EcommerceManagement/image246.png" /></p>
<p>Customers can check their current balances and transactions of sharing credit in the <strong>Transaction History</strong> section.</p>
<p>•   <strong>If the recipient’s email has been registered on the website</strong></p>
<p><img alt=" how customers send credit to friends" src="../Image_EcommerceManagement/image248.png" /></p>
<p>If the recipient’s email address has been registered on your website, our module will send credit directly to his credit balance instead of sending credit code to his email. </p>
<p><img alt=" how customers send credit to friends" src="../Image_EcommerceManagement/image250.png" /></p>
<p>Customers can check their current balances and transactions in the <strong>Transaction History</strong> section.</p>
<p><img alt=" how customers send credit to friends" src="../Image_EcommerceManagement/image252.png" /></p>
<p>At the same time, recipients can get information about this transaction.</p>
<p><strong>ii.   Case 2: Customers are required to verify their credit sharing.</strong></p>
<p><img alt=" how customers send credit to friends" src="../Image_EcommerceManagement/image254.png" /></p>
<p>If you configure that customers have to verify before sharing credit, after clicking on the <strong>Send</strong> button, they will receive an email as above.</p>
<p>At the same time, they will be navigated to the <strong>Verify</strong> page as follows. </p>
<p>On this page, our module shows them a notification about the verification requirement. In the <strong>Credit Code List</strong>, that code is put under the <strong>“Awaiting verification”</strong> status with a <strong>Verify</strong> link. </p>
<p><img alt=" how customers send credit to friends" src="../Image_EcommerceManagement/image256.png" /></p>
<p>To verify, customers can:</p>
<p>1)   Enter the verification code they received in their emails </p>
<p>2)  Click on the <strong>Submit Code</strong> button.</p>
<p>After customers finish verifying, our module will send credit to the recipient.</p>
<h6 id="redeem-credit">Redeem Credit</h6>
<p>To go to the <strong>Redeem Credit</strong> page, customers can click on the <strong>Redeem Credit</strong> tab on the left navigation.</p>
<p>On this page, customers can redeem the credit code they received to their credit balance as following steps:</p>
<p><img alt="redeem credit" src="../Image_EcommerceManagement/image258.png" /></p>
<p>1)  Enter the code in the text field </p>
<p>2)  Clicking on the <strong>Redeem</strong> button.</p>
<p>Another way is just to click on the link in the email. </p>
<p><img alt=" redeem credit" src="../Image_EcommerceManagement/image260.png" /></p>
<p>After redeeming code, customers can check their current balance and transaction in the <strong>Transaction History</strong> section.</p>
<h5 id="how-customers-check-out-by-credit">How customers check out by Credit</h5>
<p>Customers can use credit to checkout on both <strong>Shopping Cart and Checkout</strong> page.</p>
<p><img alt="how customers check out by credit" src="../Image_EcommerceManagement/image262.png" /></p>

<p>To use a credit amount, customers can:</p>
<p>1)  Enter that number in the field </p>
<p>2)  Click on the <strong>Apply</strong> button. </p>
<p>Our module will auto-update and calculate the grand total of order.</p>
<p><img alt=" how customers check out by credit" src="../Image_EcommerceManagement/image264.png" /></p>
<p>Please note that customers cannot use credit to buy credit products. If their carts have one or more credit products, our module will show a notification in the <strong>Customer Credit</strong> block as above.</p>
<p><img alt=" how customers check out by credit" src="../Image_EcommerceManagement/image266.png" /></p>
<p>On the <strong>Checkout</strong> page, in the <strong>Payment Information</strong> tab, apply credit discount the same as in the <strong>Shopping Cart</strong> page. </p>
