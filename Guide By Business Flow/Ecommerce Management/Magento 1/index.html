<p>For example, you want to apply this rule only for Category  named Tops &amp; Blousers; you can configure the condition as in the below:</p>

<p>✓ Choose <strong>Action</strong>: Discount for every X points </p>
<p>✓ Fill in field <strong>Points</strong> (X): 5 </p>
<p>➪  With every 5 points customers spent, they can receive a corresponding discount. For example, 5 points can be spent to get $1, 10 points can get $2 and so on.</p>
<p><img alt=" Manage Catalog Spending rules" src="../Image_EcommerceManagementM1/image077.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Option 2: Spend X points for every Y amount of Price</strong>: </p>

<p><strong>Actions tab</strong>:</p>
<p>In the <strong>Action</strong> tab, you can configure how prices of products are discounted after Customers use points:</p>

<p>There are four discount types:
✓ By Fixed Amount</p>
<p>✓ To Fixed Amount</p>
<p>✓ By Percentage of the original price</p>

✓ Choose <strong>Discount Type</strong>: By a fixed amount or To a fixed amount </p>

</ol>
<p>Notice that in this field, there are two options for you to choose</p>
<p><strong>Option 1: Give discount for fixed X points</strong>: </p>
<p>Customer can ONLY spend X points on whatever order they place.</p>
<p>For example, If you want to allow Customers to spend 5 points only on a shopping cart to get the discount, then you can configure as below:</p>
<p>✓ Choose <strong>Action</strong>: Give discount for fixed X points </p>
<p>✓ Fill in field <strong>Points</strong> (X): 5</p>
<p>➪ If Customers place an order of $500.00 or $800.00, they can spend only 5 points in both cases.</p>
<p><img alt=" Manage Shopping Cart Spending Rules" src="../Image_EcommerceManagementM1/image084.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Option 2: Give discount for every X points</strong>:
 Customers can receive discounts proportionally to the number of points they spent.</p>
<p>If you want to give discount for every 5 points Customers spend on the order and limit the number of points that can be used to 15, then:</p>
<p>✓ Choose <strong>Action</strong>: Give discount for every X points </p>
<p>✓ Fill in field <strong>Points</strong> (X): 5 </p>
<p>✓ Fill in field  <strong>Max points spent by this rule</strong>: 15 </p>
<p>➪ With every 5 points customers spent, they can receive a corresponding discount. For example, 5 points can be spent to get $1, 10 points can get $2.00 and so on. But they cannot use more than 15 points as that is the max points that can be spent by this rule.</p>
<p><strong>Actions tab</strong>:</p>

<p>First, Customers should click on the <strong>Send Credit</strong> tab on the left navigation to go to the <strong>Send Credit to Friends</strong> page.</p>
<p>This page has 2 parts including <strong>Send Credit To Friends</strong> and <strong>Credit Code List</strong>.</p>

<p>✓ <strong>Credit Code List</strong>: This section shows all information about the credit codes that Customers sent to their friends including <strong>code, recipient email, amount, sent date</strong> and <strong>status of code</strong>. Credit codes are not displayed in full for security purpose. When Customers click on, they will be shown clearly.</p>
<p>Please note that our module allows you to configure whether to require your Customers to verify their credit sharing or not. We will consider the two cases separately.</p>
<p><strong>Case 1: Customers are not required to verify their credit sharing</strong>.</p>
<p>In order to send credit to friends, Customers should enter the recipient’s email and credit amount in the text fields. Our module will check that email address and show notification to Customers.</p>
<p>•   <strong>If the recipient’s email has not been registered on the website</strong>: </p>
<p><img alt=" customers send credit to friends" src="../Image_EcommerceManagementM1/image179.png" /></p>
<p>In this case, our module will show a notification for the Customer that his friend will receive the credit code via that email. The Customer can enter a message and click on the <strong>Send</strong> button. After that, his credit balance will be deducted immediately and an email will be auto-sent to the recipient’s email address:</p>
<p><img alt=" customers send credit to friends" src="../Image_EcommerceManagementM1/image180.png" /></p>
<p>As you can see, this email informs the recipient about the credit amount, message and a credit code which can be used to redeem credit to his balance.
At the same time, the sender can also see the sent credit code in the <strong>Credit Code List</strong> section as below:</p>
<p><img alt=" customers send credit to friends" src="../Image_EcommerceManagementM1/image181.png" /></p>
<p>In this section, Customers can follow the status of the credit codes they sent. When a recipient has not redeemed a credit code, Customers are allowed to cancel it by clicking on the <strong>Cancel</strong> link in the <strong>Action</strong> column. After the cancellation, the recipient cannot redeem that credit code any more.</p>
<p>Otherwise, once the credit code has been redeemed, the status will be updated and the <strong>Cancel</strong> link will be disabled. Please refer to the section <strong>Redeem Credit below</strong> for more information.</p>
<p>Customers can check their current balances and transactions of sharing credit in the <strong>Transaction History</strong> section.</p>
<p><img alt=" customers send credit to friends" src="../Image_EcommerceManagementM1/image182.png" /></p>
<p>•   <strong>If the recipient’s email has been registered on the website</strong>: </p>
