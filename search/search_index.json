After that, the sender\u2019s credit balance will be deducted immediately and an email will be auto-sent to the recipient\u2019s email address.\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, this email informs the recipient about the credit amount, message and a credit code which can be used to redeem credit to his balance.\n\n\n\n\nAt the same time, the sender can also see the sent credit code in the \nCredit Code List\n section as above.\n\n\nIn this section, customers can follow the status of the credit codes they sent. While the recipient has not redeemed a credit code, customers are allowed to cancel it by clicking on the \nCancel\n link in the \nAction\n column. After the cancellation, the recipient cannot redeem that credit code any more.\n\n\nOtherwise, once the credit code has been redeemed, the status will be updated and the \nCancel\n link will be disabled.

There are three types of credit products for customers to choose: fixed values, range of values and drop-down values.    \u2022    Fixed Value : These credit products have fixed value.    \u2022    Drop-down Values : With this type, customers can select a specific value in the drop-down list.   \u2022    Range of Values : With this type, customers can choose a desired credit amount within the range configured by admin in backend.    After selecting credit products they like, customers can add them to cart and checkout normally.  When the order is complete, our module will auto-add that credit amount to the customer\u2019s credit balance.   Customers can also send Credits to their friends  1)  Tick  Send credit to friend  checkbox   2)  Enter the name of the recipient   3)  Enter the email address of the recipient. The system will send an email to this address  4)  Enter the message that recipient will receive.  Option 2:  In this second way, they will be navigated to the  My Credit  page on which they just need to click on the  Buy store credit  button. See section  Send Credit to Friends  to see how it works for customers.   When the order is completed, there will be two cases happening based on signup status of the recipient email address.    \u2022    Case 1 : if the recipient do not have an account in the system, an email as above will be sent.  \u2022    Case 2 : if the recipient has already had an account in the system, the system will automatically add that credit amount to the Recipient\u2019s credit balance.

After that, the sender\u2019s credit balance will be deducted immediately and an email will be auto-sent to the recipient\u2019s email address.   As you can see, this email informs the recipient about the credit amount, message and a credit code which can be used to redeem credit to his balance.   At the same time, the sender can also see the sent credit code in the  Credit Code List  section as above.  In this section, customers can follow the status of the credit codes they sent. While the recipient has not redeemed a credit code, customers are allowed to cancel it by clicking on the  Cancel  link in the  Action  column. After the cancellation, the recipient cannot redeem that credit code any more.  Otherwise, once the credit code has been redeemed, the status will be updated and the  Cancel  link will be disabled. Please refer to the section    Redeem Credit  for more information.

Customers can check their current balances and transactions in the  Transaction History  section.   At the same time, recipients can get information about this transaction.  ii.   Case 2: Customers are required to verify their credit sharing.

To verify, customers can:  1)   Enter the verification code they received in their emails   2)  Click on the  Submit Code  button.

The following part will guide you through how to configure and manage the extension in back-end.\n\n\nNew release:\n One of the most important Google Maps APIs Standard Plan updates implemented on June 22, 2016 was that required future product updates are only available for requests made with an API key.\n\n\nThis means active domains created before June 22, 2016, continue to be able to access the Google Maps JavaScript API, Static Maps API, and Street View Image API without an API key. They are not affected by keyless access being unavailable for new domains. \n\n\nHowever, Google Maps APIs Standard Plan advise all developers to use a key to guarantee their quality of service. Applications that continue to make keyless requests may experience some periodic service degradation if other keyless applications' usage spikes and draws down the global unchanged quota.\nTo get API key, follow these steps as follows: \n\n\nStep 1:\n Visit APIs Console at https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library and log into your Google Account.  Then, click Create project button on top of the menu. \n\n\n\n\nStep 2:\n Fill in the project name and click Create button\n\n\n\n\nStep 3:\n On the menu at the left side, you will see the \nCredentials\n Tab. \n\n\nClick this tab and after that, a box will appear with \nAPI key\n on it. It is where you should click to create API key for your browser apps.\n\n\n\n\nAfter that you will see a box with number of choices specifying which kind of key you would like to create. Choose \nBrowser key\n \n\n\n\n\nStep 4:\n Fill in your name and domain and then click create\n\n\n\n\nStep 5:\n Get the key and paste it in your page \n\n\n\n\nStep 6:\n After all, in \nLibrary\n tab, enable the APIs in red frame as below \n\n\n\n\nHoliday Setting\n\n\nPath: \nStore Pickup > Manage Holidays >\n click on \nAdd Holiday\n\n\n\n\n(1) Fill in \nHoliday Name, Store, Starting Date, End Date\n and \nComment\n - which is shown as notification to customers\n\n\n(2) Remember to click \nSave Item\n if you\u2019ve done or \nSave and Continue Edit\n to avoid losing what you\u2019ve written. \n\n\nOR ELSE, you can click on \nReset\n to delete all you\u2019ve created or \nBack\n to delete all and come back to the Manage Holiday Page.\n\n\nSpecial Day Setting\n\n\nPath: \nStore Pickup > Manage Special Days >\n click on \nAdd Special Day\n\n\n\n\n(1) Fill in \nSpecial Day Name\n and select \nStore, Starting Date, End Date\n\n\n(2) \nTimer Interval:\n Set Time Interval between 2 shipping times\n\n\n(3) \nOpening Time\n and \nClosing Time:\n choose working time for special day\n\n\n(4) \nComment:\n enter comment which will be shown as notification to your customers. \n\n\nRemember to click \nSave\n to finish\n\n\nTag Setting\n\n\nPath: \nStore Pickup > Manage Tags >\n click on \nAdd Tag\n\n\n\n\n(1) \nName:\n Enter the name\n\n\n(2) \nTag Icon: Choose File\n to upload Icon\n\n\n(3) \nStatus:\n choose \nEnabled\n to activate the tag\n\n\nShipment Method\n\n\nPath: \nSystem > Configuration > Sales > Shipping Methods > Web POS Shipping\n\n\n\n\n(1) You can edit these fields as below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnabled:\n choose \nYes\n to activate Web POS Shipping\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarrier title:\n enter the carrier title\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod title:\n enter the method title\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrice:\n enter the price of this method/service (Once you edit, the price will be default)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(2) \nCustome Methods:\n\n\nYou can have another option for Web POS Shipping by creating as below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustom Method Title: \n enter the name of method title\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustom Method Price: \n enter the price of the Custom Method.

If you don\u2019t receive the email, you can directly login to your account dashboard at MageStore then go to  My Account/My License Certificates . Here you will select your  Order number  and a corresponding  Product  then type the  back-end domain of your live site . It is optional to add your Development Domains right or later. Click on the  Generate Certificate  button to get your  License Certificate.   Note:   License Certificate  is a PDF document that contains your License Information including your Product Name, License Serial, License Type, Registered Domain, Expiration date, etc. Your  License Serial  is unique and can only be used once for one module. You can go to MageStore  Check License Information  page, enter your License Serial to check your license status. You can also view your License Information in back-end when your module installation is finished.    Go to  My Downloadable Products . Choose the version of the module then download it. The file that you download is normally a zip file.    It\u2019s required to enable cache in the administration panel of your site. Go to  System/Cache Management . Choose all caches and click on  Enable  then submit.    Use FTP client (such as Filezilla, WinSCP, cuteFtp) to upload or copy all folders in the zip package to your Magento site root folder.

Go to  System/Cache Management . Select all caches and take action  Refresh  then submit.    Navigate to  System/Configuration . If you can see the module tab, it is installed properly.    Now if you get access denied error when click on the module tab, you need to log out admin panel and log in again.    Go to front-end and try to process, make sure that everything is OK.    Note:  In the case that you have followed all above steps but couldn\u2019t make the module work properly, to make your website function as normal, you can delete the file or change the module\u2019s filename module in  app/etc/magestore_module_name.xml  (for example, change  Magestore_Affiliateplus.xml  to  Magestore_Affiliateplus.xml.bka  ).

New release:  One of the most important Google Maps APIs Standard Plan updates implemented on June 22, 2016 was that required future product updates are only available for requests made with an API key.  This means active domains created before June 22, 2016, continue to be able to access the Google Maps JavaScript API, Static Maps API, and Street View Image API without an API key. They are not affected by keyless access being unavailable for new domains.   However, Google Maps APIs Standard Plan advise all developers to use a key to guarantee their quality of service. Applications that continue to make keyless requests may experience some periodic service degradation if other keyless applications' usage spikes and draws down the global unchanged quota.\nTo get API key, follow these steps as follows:   Step 1:  Visit APIs Console at https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library and log into your Google Account.  Then, click Create project button on top of the menu.    Step 2:  Fill in the project name and click Create button   Step 3:  On the menu at the left side, you will see the  Credentials  Tab.   Click this tab and after that, a box will appear with  API key  on it. It is where you should click to create API key for your browser apps.   After that you will see a box with number of choices specifying which kind of key you would like to create. Choose  Browser key     Step 4:  Fill in your name and domain and then click create   Step 5:  Get the key and paste it in your page    Step 6:  After all, in  Library  tab, enable the APIs in red frame as below",

Those actions happen in turn, again and again, so your store will have cash in as well as cash out. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTE: \nThis function is available now in Magento 2 and will be updated soon for  Magento 1. \n\n\nPOS Order\n\n\nLike the flow we explain above, this section is also instructed according to the timing circle. Particularly, it is the customer buying process. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInitially, Customers select products to buy and bring them to Cashier\n   to pay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, Cashier could add them to carts.\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnyway, one thing to remind retailers is that having a customer card system is extremely necessary for sales strategy. So, it exists a demand from POS System: make sure all of the shoppers, even when they are not regular consumers, have member cards at your store. \n\n\n\n\nIf this buyer were a brand new customer, Cashier would create a new one.  Here is the detailed instruction:\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\nTap the human icon > \u201cCreate Customer\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOtherwise, Cashier could search and create order based on customer history data.

If the order meets the refund condition, then POS staffs go to the next process of refunding. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTE: Some certain staffs have permission to issue refund by cash/credits (which is set by admin in the backend). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2\n: Implement Refund Process \n\n\n\n\nTo issue refund, go to Orders tab in POS screen, choose Orders History, select the order that is required to refund.  Tap on Refund button at the end of the popup.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nA popup will display so that you can fill in the information before making refund.  Tick \u201cReturn to stock\u201d if you want to return those items back to your stock.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[1]  Name of the refund product\n\n\n[2]  Adjust Refund:\n\n\n[3] Adjust Fee:\n\n\n[4] Refund by Credits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead of refund by cash, you can refund for customer a certain amount of credits to keep them around your store and purchase next time. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHit \u201c\nSubmit Refund\n\u201d. After that, you will get the message informing that credit memo is created successfully.

Those actions happen in turn, again and again, so your store will have cash in as well as cash out. \n\n\nOn the screen of POS System, it will be displayed like this\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, at the end of the day, POS Managers must undertake mission to create Closing Balance, which means they have to confirm the amount of cash in store after all transactions on that day.

If the order meets the refund condition, then POS staffs go to the next process of refunding. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTE: Some certain staffs have permission to issue refund by cash/credits (which is set by admin in the backend). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2\n: Implement Refund Process \n\n\n\n\nTo issue refund, go to Orders tab in POS screen, choose Orders History, select the order that is required to refund.

The code uses a sequence of vertical bars and spaces to represent numbers and other symbols. Barcode is a reliable method for cutting costs and savingtime for business.\n\n\nBarcode management module from Magestore provides your business with a handful solution to generate barcode, print barcode label and scan barcode, all in one.\n\n\nMagento Barcode Management\n is one module in our \nOmnichannel solution\n for Magento retailers.\n\n\n\n\nHOW IT WORKS\n\n\nBarcode listing\n\n\nBarcode listing is a view to display all barcodes of all products saved in Inventory Management. It contains Barcode, SKU, Supplier and Purchased Time.\n\n\nFrom this screen, admin can instantly take actions like importing or generating barcode with 5 buttons on the top right.\n\n\n\n\nAdmin can also view details of each product and barcode. \n\n\n\n\nFrom barcode detailed page, admin can configure barcode printing and print barcode directly. Product information is shown including Image, name, price and its availability in each warehouse.\n\n\nGenerate barcode\n\n\nInventory Management gives you 2 modes to generate barcode:\n\n\n\n\nOne barcode per product SKU\n\n\nMultiple barcodes per product SKU\nThis can be configured in Barcode Settings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you set \u201cOne barcode per product SKU\u201d as \u201cYes\u201d, then the system will allow you to generate only one barcode for one product SKU.\nNow to generate barcode, you go to Generate Barcodes tab. From here you can select the product that you want to generate barcode, fill in the Supplier (optional) then generate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you set \u201cOne barcode per product SKU\u201d as \u201cNo\u201d, then it opens up 2 options to generate barcode when you go to Generate Barcodes tab.\n\n\n\n\nGenerate Barcode\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese 2 options are: Generate barcode per item or Generate barcode per purchase.\n\u201cGenerate barcode per item\u201d means each item will have its own identified barcode although they have the same SKU.\n\n\n\u201cGenerate barcode per purchase\u201d means items will be identified by the time it is purchased. Although you take 10 items with same SKU in one time purchasing from supplier, these 10 items will have the same barcode. But in another time of purchase, they will have different barcode.\n\n\nAfter selecting the option you want to proceed with, you can continue selecting product, fill the product Qty., supplier and purchased time (optional) then generate. \n\n\nAdmin can configure the barcode pattern to generate. Barcodes generated will be saved in Barcode listing page & Barcode creating history.\n\n\n\n\nImport barcode\n\n\nWhen you generate barcodes in mass, you will not need to use Generate barcode feature. Instead, you can import barcode directly into the system using the \nImport barcode\n feature of Inventory Management.\n\n\nThe system provides a sample import file including SKU, Barcode, Qty. and Supplier & Purchase time (optional).\n\n\n\n\nAfter preparing the file as in the sample file, now you can upload the file, fill the reason and start to import.\n\n\nBarcode label template\n\n\nYou can create your own barcode template by adding new template. There are also 3 most used templates as default templates: \nA4\n, \nJewelry\n and \nStandard\n for you to select.\n\n\n\n\nYou can configure paper width and height, label width and height, font size\u2026and preview the template before saving. \n\n\n\n\nPrint barcode\n\n\nIn Barcode configuration, admin can select the barcode template from the templates created before to print. \n\n\n\n\nAdmin can select multiple barcodes to print at once. Or click to \nView\n under Action column to print one barcode multiple times.\n\n\n\n\nScan barcode\n\n\nIn our inventory management modules, you need to use a Barcode scanner which is able to connect with your computer. Then you can scan to read product information or update stock Qty. when doing Stock taking (Stock taking is a function available in Magestore's inventory management solution) or managing purchase orders.\n\n\n\n\nWhen going to Scan Barcode, you can read barcode information and product information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Stock-taking, there are 5 steps: \n1- General information\n, \n2-Prepare products\n, \n3-Stock counting\n, \n4-Complete data entry\n, \n5-Complete Stocktaking\n. You can scan barcode to choose products in step 2-Prepare products and count stock quantity in step 3-Stock counting. (For more details of Physical Stock taking, please refer to Inventory Management user guide.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfidential Information Notice\n\n\nCopyright 2017. All Rights Reserved.

You should pay attention to the following tabs:\n\n\n\n\nGeneral\n tab:\n\n\n\n\nDifferent from normal products, there is another required field, \nSelect Gift Card template\n, allowing you to choose templates for Gift Card product. You can add more templates to this field in \nManage Gift Card Templates\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrices\n tab:\n\n\n\n\nIn \nPrices\n tab, Admin can configure prices and values of a Gift Card Product.\n\n\n\nThe module provides 3 \ntypes of Gift Card value\n, including \nfixed value, range of values and dropdown values\n. You can base on the type chosen to set Gift Card value(s) accordingly such as 50-100 (USD) for the \nrange of values\n type.\n\n\nThe next step you need to do is selecting the type of Gift Card price, which could be 1 in 3 following options:\n\n\n\n\nDefault\n: Gift Card price is the same as Gift Card value by default.\n\n\nFixed number\n: Gift Card price is a fixed number as you configure in the next field.\n\n\nPercent of Gift Card value\n: Gift Card price is a percentage of Gift Card value as you configure in the next field.\n\n\n\n\nIf you choose the type of Gift Card price as \nFixed number\n or \nPercent of Gift Card value\n, remember to fill in the next field \nPrice/ Percentage\n to set the price for your Gift Card product.\n\n\nThe following example will help you have better understanding about these configurations.\n\n\n\n\nType of Gift Card value\n: Dropdown values\n\n\nGift Card values\n: 20,30,40\n\n\nType of Gift Card price\n: Percent of Gift Card value\n\n\nPercentage\n: 90,90,90\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo Customers only have to pay 90% of Gift Card value, which means $36 for a $40 Gift Card for instance.\n\n \n\n\n\n\nConditions\n tabs:\n\n\n\n\nThe difference between a Gift Card product and a normal product is that a Gift Card product contains 2 more condition tabs, which are \nShopping Cart Conditions\n and \nCart Item Conditions\n.\n\n\n\n\nThe \nShopping Cart Conditions\n tab enables you to set up the conditions applied to shopping cart when Customers use Gift Card, for example: Customers can only use their Gift Card for orders which have Subtotal equals or is greater than $200.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nCart Item Conditions\n tab allows you to set up Gift Card usage conditions applied to each item in Customers\u2019 shopping cart. For example, Customers can use their Gift Cards to pay for orders only if the Qty. in cart is equal or greater than 2.\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n: Normally some common product attributes are enabled to use with promotion rules by default. If you don\u2019t see the attribute you want when setting \nGift Card\u2019s Conditions\n, such as SKU, you can go to Catalog\u2192 Attributes\u2192 Manage Attributes. Search and choose Attribute Code, such as \"SKU\". Then change \"Use for Promo Rule Conditions\" to \"Yes\"\n\n\nRemember to click on \nSave\n or \nSave and Continue Edit\n button to save your work.

And how to keep track of each item's quantity change? Magestore's Instock Management module is here to help. With this inventory management module, you are able to:\n\n\n\n\nSave time in stock control by in-line mass adjustment;\n\n\nReduce cost by low stock notifications and supply need forecast in time;\n\n\nAvoid stock loss with convenient 5-step stock taking process.\n\n\n\n\nMagento \nInventory Management\n is one module in our \nOmnichannel solution\n for Magento retailers.\n\n\nTerminologies and principles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerminology\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuantity in warehouse(s)\n\n\nThe real quantity of a product in the physical warehouse. It equals the sum of Available Qty and Qty to Ship\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAvailable Quantity\n\n\nThe quantity of each product which shows up in Virtual Catalog (front store). It\u2019s also the quantity remaining that are available to be sold\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuantity to ship\n\n\nThe number of items has been ordered but not been shipped yet. This number will be returned to Avail Qty & Qty in Warehouse(s) if the shipment is cancelled\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShelf Location\n\n\nInsert the detailed area in the shelf where the product is located. This is how you can support your staff in finding the product efficiently in the physical warehouse\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarehouse\n\n\nA \u201cwarehouse\u201d in Inventory Management represents for a physical place where you keep your stock. Stocks can be moved between warehouses, purchased for a Warehouse and shipped from a Warehouse. Employees (with different admin accounts) can be restricted to handling only warehouse(s) with which they work\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrimary Warehouse\n\n\nPrimary Warehouse is automatically created after the module is installed which contains all products in your catalog. This warehouse cannot be deleted to make sure that there is always at least one warehouse consisting of your inventory\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarehouse Pemission\n\n\nAssign and manage a staff account permission level in controlling a specific warehouse. Base on Roles Assigned, an user who has full authorities will have permission to create new role & set up new user with specific permissions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStock Adjustment\n\n\nAdjust Stock action is used to correct/ update inventory levels of your products and records them in Stock Adjustment History. This will change the product's Qty. in the Stock in Warehouse grid. After that, the system will update Available Qty. accordingly (or the quantity in default Catalog Products) after subtracting Qty allocated in sales orders from the new Qty in Warehouse\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStock Adjustment History\n\n\nStock Adjustment History records all inventory corrections/ updates when there are some differences between stock levels of physical and virtual warehouses\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStocktaking\n\n\nStocktaking is performed to double-check and prevent any mismatch between the recorded product quantities and the actual inventory in your physical warehouses. The process includes 5 stages containing stock counting and admin\u2019s approval before actually updating the Qty in the system\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStocktaking History\n\n\nStocktaking History records all stocktaking acts and their process status\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStock Movement History\n\n\nStock Movements are records of inward &outward stock transfers of your primary warehouse\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupply Needs\n\n\nSupply Need is the system\u2019s prediction about how many inventory items you need for each product within a future period. The system will calculate this number based on your sales history in the corresponding period in the past\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAvailable Date\n\n\nBased on the sales history in the chosen sales period, the system will estimate the day which a product is sold out and need to be restocked\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLow-stock Threshold Type\n\n\nTo get notification about the out-of-stock product, you will have to define how the system process. There are 2 methods: by Available Days or by Available Quantity\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThreshold (days)\n\n\nIf you insert 3 in this field, the low stock notification will appear 3 days before the product is out of stock. The  sold out day is estimated based on sales history of the chosen sales period\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSales Period (days)\n\n\nIf you insert 30 in this field, the threshold days will be estimated based on sales history in 30 days up to now\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThreshold (quantity)\n\n\nIf you insert 5 in this field, the low stock notification will appear when there are only 5 items of the product in stock\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLow Stock Notifications\n\n\nLow Stock Notification shows all notifications following Low Stock Rules set up in the system. You can track the detail of a notification such as Warning Message, Low Stock Threshold Type, Notification Recipients here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow To Configure\n\n\nGo to \nSettings\n and you are able to configure the Instock Management module as below:\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nLink stocks in Warehouse to Front Store View\n: The Instock Management module allows synchronization between the warehouse and its Magento front store. This means when you edit information or product quantity of a warehouse, this information will automatically be updated in that warehouse\u2019s front store and visible to customers.\nAfter enabling this setting, you can link the warehouse to one or multiple store view in \nWarehouses > General Information > Magento Store View\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjust Stock by entering the change qty\n: \n\n\nIf this feature is enabled, when adjusting stock, you can enter the difference quantity and the system will calculate the final balance in warehouse.\n\n\nIf this feature is disabled, you need to enter the exact quantity of stock in warehouse and the system will recognize this figure as the latest available quantity of product. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow To Use\n\n\n \n\n\nStock Listing\n\n\nAfter installation, the system will automatically provide a Primary Warehouse. This Primary Warehouse cannot be deleted but can only be edited. All the existing products will be automatically synced from your website to this warehouse. \n\n\nThis function consists of 3 tabs to help you manage your inventory successfully:\n\n\n\n\nStock in Warehouse\n: provides an overview of stocks in your primary warehouse\n\n\nNon-warehouse Products\n: lists out a newly-created product which has not been assigned to the primary warehouse\n\n\nWarehouses\n: allows you to view and edit details of your warehouses\n\n\n\n\nStock in Warehouse\n\n\nThis tab provides an overview of stocks in all warehouses. Here you can view stock SKU, Name, Price, Qty in Warehouse(s), Qty to Ship, Available Qty, Products in Warehouse(s), Stock Movement and Product Status. \n\n\nThe module provides an in-depth control over your \ncomposite products\n (configurable, bundle and grouped products).  You can see 3 quantity types of each variation or component of the composite product in the warehouse. \n\n\nFor example, if you have a configurable product whose root SKU is Pwt007, you can see the quantities of each available size. If you sell products which often have different sizes and colors like clothing, this is an efficient way to control your inventory. \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNote that there are 3 types of quantity shown:\n\n\n\n\nQty in Warehouse(s)\n: total amount of products in physical warehouses;\n\n\nQty to ship\n: the number of products which has been ordered and is ready to be shipped;\n\n\nAvailable Qty\n: the amount of products left in the virtual catalog which is available to sell.\n\n\n\n\nNote that \nQty in Warehouse(s) = Qty to Ship + Available Qty\n\n\n\n\nUpdate the total quantity and Shelf Location easily on the Inventory grid in only 3 steps:\n\n\n\n\nSelect the product(s);\n\n\nInput the new Qty in Warehouse;\n\n\nInput location of the shelf on which the product is placed (optional);\n\n\nClick \nUpdate Stock\n.\n\n\n\n\nShelf Allocation\n is a useful information to find the product in the physical stock quickly, especially in fulfilling customer\u2019s order.\n\n\nNon-warehouse Products\n\n\nWhen a product is newly-created and has not been assigned to warehouse yet, it will automatically be allocated in this Non-warehouse list. From here, you can select a product and add it into your warehouse. This prevents you from accidentally including disqualified products into your warehouse and wasting time searching for it later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect the product(s);\n\n\nIn \nActions\n menu, choose \"Add to Warehouse\" from the drop-down list;\n\n\nClick \nSubmit\n\n\n\n\nWarehouses\n\n\nThe \nWarehouses\n menu allows you to control your warehouse with 5 tabs:\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Information\n: records basic details of the warehouse such as Name, Code, Contact Email, Address, etc. If you enable the \nLink warehouse to Magento front store view\n setting above, this is where you can select the warehouse\u2019s linked front store.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nStock On Hand\n: lists out all existing products in the warehouse. Selecting product(s) will let you promptly revise its total Qty in the specific Warehouse and its Shelf Location. \n\n\n\n\nOn this section, if you click on any warehouses, there will have \nExport\n button along with CSV/Excel XML file.\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStock Movement\n: provides stock changing record of the warehouse. Information includes added/ subtracted quantity, product SKU, movement type, movement date and reference number to access further details by a click.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarehouse Permission\n: lets you assign and manage staff account permission. Here you can set staff permission by clicking at the \nAssign Staffs\n button at the right of the page. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn \nAssign Staff\n window will appear as in the screenshot below. All you need to do is:\n1. Select staff \n2. Choose his/her role from the drop-down list (you can create more roles in Magento core backend). You can assign role to multiple staff at once.\n3. Click \nAdd Selected Staff\n button and you are done!\n\n\n\n\nYou can also select to edit/delete staff permission directly on the \nWarehouse Permission\n menu.\nFinally, do not forget to save your recent changes.\n\n\n\n\nADDITIONAL GUIDE\n: Manage User/ Staff Roles and Permissions\nIf you want to create and/or edit user roles and permissions in different sections in the Instock Management module, go to Magento core backend, \nSystem > Permission\n\n\n\n\nThe \nUser\n tab lists out all users with details like ID, Username, First name, Last name, Email and Status of the account.

Also with our Magento Store Credit module, credit can be used as a convenient and time-saving payment method when it just requires your Customers to recharge their credit accounts one time and then use for many future purchases.\n\n\nMagento \nStore Credit\n is one module in our \nOmnichannel solution\n for Magento retailers.\n\n\n\n\nHOW TO USE\n\n\nBuy Credit Product\n\n\nAfter Customers login to your website, they can access the \nStore Credit\n page in two ways.\n\n\nFirstly, clicking on the \nMy Account\n link, they can choose \nBuy Store Credit\n in the dropdown list. \n\n\n\nSecondly, they can click on the \nMy Credit\n tab on the left navigation on the \nMy Account\n page.\n\n\nIn this second way, they will be navigated to the \nMy Credit\n page on which they just need to click on the \nBuy store credit\n button:\n\n\n\n\nAfter that, the \nStore Credit\n page will be shown as follows:\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAs you can see, this page lists all credit products of your website. There are three types of credit products for Customers to choose:\n\n\n\n\nFixed Value\n: These credit products have fixed value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption Value:\n With this type, Customers can select a value option in the drop-down list box.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRange Value\n: With this type, Customers can choose a desired credit amount within the range configured by admin in backend.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter selecting credit products they like, Customers can add them to cart and checkout normally.\n\n\n\n\nWhen the order is complete, our module will auto-add that credit amount to the Customer\u2019s credit balance.\n\n \n\n\nCustomers can also send Credits to their friends by ticking \nSend credit to friend\n checkbox and enter all the required fields:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecipient name\n: the name of the recipient\n\n\nRecipient email address\n: the email address of the recipient. The\n   system will send an email to this address.\n\n\nCustom message\n: the message that recipient will receive\n\n\n\n\nWhen the order is complete, if the recipient do not have an account in the system will receive an email as below:\n\n\n\n\nIf the recipient has an account in the system, our module will auto-add that credit amount to the Recipient\u2019s credit balance.\n\n\n\n\nThe sender always gets email notifications as below:\n\n\n\n\nManage Credit on My Credit page\n\n\nIn order to access the \nMy Credit\n page, Customers can click on the \nMy Credit\n tab on the left navigation.\n\n\nManage Credit Balance\n\n\nOn the \nMy Credit\n page, Customers can view information about their current credit balances and transaction history.\n\n\nIn the section \nTransaction History\n, our module shows Customers all of their credit transactions with a lot of information including \ndate, type, details, added/deducted value in transaction\n and \ncredit balance.\n\n\n\n\nSend Credit to Friends\n\n\nFirst, Customers should click on the \nSend Credit\n tab on the left navigation to go to the \nSend Credit to Friends\n page.\n\n\nThis page has 2 parts including \nSend Credit To Friends\n and \nCredit Code List\n.\n\n\n\n\n\u2022   \nSend Credit to Friends\n: In this section, Customers can send credit to their friends.\n\n\n\u2022   \nCredit Code List\n: This section shows all information about the credit codes that Customers sent to their friends including \ncode, recipient email, amount, sent date\n and \nstatus of code\n. Credit codes are not displayed in full for security purpose. When Customers click on, they will be shown clearly.\n\n\nPlease note that our module allows you to configure whether to require your Customers to verify their credit sharing or not. We will consider the two cases separately.\n\n\nCase 1: Customers are not required to verify their credit sharing.\n\n\nIn order to send credit to friends, Customers should enter the recipient\u2019s email and credit amount in the text fields. Our module will check that email address and show notification to Customers.\n\n\n\n\nIf the recipient\u2019s email has not been registered on the website:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this case, our module will show a notification for the Customer that his friend will receive the credit code via that email. The Customer can enter a message and click on the \nSend\n button. \nAfter that, his credit balance will be deducted immediately and an email will be auto-sent to the recipient\u2019s email address:\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, this email informs the recipient about the credit amount, message and a credit code which can be used to redeem credit to his balance.\n\n\nAt the same time, the sender can also see the sent credit code in the \nCredit Code List\n section as below:\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, Customers can follow the status of the credit codes they sent. When a recipient has not redeemed a credit code, Customers are allowed to cancel it by clicking on the \nCancel\n link in the \nAction\n column. After the cancellation, the recipient cannot redeem that credit code any more.\n\n\nOtherwise, once the credit code has been redeemed, the status will be updated and the Cancel link will be disabled. Please refer to the section \nRedeem Credit\n for more information.\n\n\nCustomers can check their current balances and transactions of sharing credit in the \nTransaction History\n section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the recipient\u2019s email has been registered on the website:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the recipient\u2019s email address has been registered on your website, our module will send credit directly to his credit balance instead of sending credit code to his email.\nCustomers can check their current balances and transactions in the \nTransaction History\n section.\n\n\n\n\nAt the same time, recipients can get information about this transaction:\n\n\n\n\nCase 2: Customers are required to verify their credit sharing.\n\n\nIf you configure that Customers have to verify before sharing credit, after clicking on the \nSend\n button, they will receive an email as below:\n\n\n\n\nAt the same time, they will be navigated to the \nVerify\n page:\n\n\n\n\nOn this page, our module shows them a notification about the verification requirement. In the \nCredit Code List\n, that code is put under the \u201c\nAwaiting verification\n\u201d status with a \nVerify\n link. \n\n\nTo verify, Customers just enter the verification code they received in their emails and then click on the \nSubmit Code\n button.\n\n\nAfter Customers finish verifying, our module will send credit to the recipient.\n\n\nRedeem Credit\n\n\nIn order to go to the \nRedeem Credit\n page, Customers can click on the \nRedeem Credit\n tab on the left navigation.\n\n\n\n\nOn this page, Customers can redeem the credit code they received to their credit balance by entering the code in the text field before clicking on the \nRedeem\n button. Another way is just to click on the link in the email.\n\n\nAfter redeeming code, Customers can check their current balance and transaction in the \nTransaction History\n section.\n\n\n\n\nCheckout by Credit\n\n\n \n\n\nCustomers can use credit to checkout on both \nShopping Cart\n and \nCheckout page\n.\n\n\n\n\nOn the \nShopping Cart\n page, our module will add a \nCustomer Credit\n block for Customers to use their credit balances to checkout.\n\n\nTo use a credit amount, Customers can first enter that number in the field and then click on the \nApply\n button. Our module will auto-update and calculate the grand total of order.\n\n\nPlease note that Customers cannot use credit to buy credit products. If their carts have one or more credit products, our module will show a notification in the \nCustomer Credit\n block as below:\n\n\n\n\nOn the \nCheckout page\n, in the \nPayment Information\n tab, Customers can also use credit to check out by ticking on the checkbox and then enter a credit amount they want.\n\n\n\n\nWhen Customers click on the \nContinue\n button, our module will auto-update the Grand Total of the order.\n\n\nAfter order has been placed, Customers\u2019 credit balances will be updated immediately.

Thus, 72% of retailers start allowing Customers to purchase online before coming to a store and receive purchased products. If there is a chain of stores available, undoubtedly Customers will choose the nearest one as well as an appropriate time to arrive. How can the store-owner make that happen? The answer is Magento Store Pickup module \u2013 the most professional Magento shipping module, which allows setting up multiple Magento stores, showing addresses and opening time of each store for the Customers\u2019 convenience.\n\n\nMagento \nStore Pickup\n is one module in our \nOmnichannel solution\n for Magento retailers.\n\n\n\n\nHOW TO USE\n\n\n\n\nMany times customers want to visit your physical store to pick up products ordered so they can test the quality as well as save the shipping fee. Below, let us introduce you how customers exploit all the usefulness when your store is integrated with the \nStore Pickup\n module.\n\n\nView Store Information\n\n\n \n\n\nStore Pickup module creates a separated page to list all of your stores in the front-end. Customers can access this page by clicking on \nOur Stores\n on Top-Link (the top right of the page) or Footer-Link (the bottom of the page).\n\n\n \nTop-Link\n\n\n \n\n \n\nFooter-Link\n\n\nThe Store Listing page includes 4 sections: \nStore list, Search form, Google Map\n and \nTags list.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe list of all stores is shown on the bottom of Google Map. Customers can view store names and base images on this list. \nClick on the icon \n   on the bottom right corner on the G-Map to show store list or click on the \n  to hide store list\n\n\nStore locations are displayed on Google Map. Customers can zoom in/ zoom out and choose view mode as map/ satellite as preferred. Customers can also view store address or get direction by clicking on the pin icon of any store.\n\n\nClick on the icon \n  to search stores by location. Customers need to enter the key word and select criteria. Results that are matched are shown on G-Map. \nClick on the icon \n  to search stores by radius. After customers enter the the location then choose radius, related results are shown on G-Map.\n\n\nBesides, customers can also filter by tags. Customers just have to click on tags they want to search. Then, list of stores which admin add these tags to will be shown.\n\n\n\n\nWhen customers click on a store on the map, they can instantly view the store location along with its name, address, phone number and store manager\u2019s email address. Customers can also get direction on this box.\n\n\n\n\nFor more details of a store, customers can click on its \nView more info\n link to be navigated to the detailed page.\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, this page shows all details that customers want to know about a store before arriving, such as location, contact info, working time, description and store images. \n\n\nThey can also view list of special days & holidays in \nSpecial day & Holiday information\n tab.\nConveniently, they can email store manager by filling in the contact form then clicking on \nSubmit\n.\n\n\nUse Store Pickup at Checkout\n\n\nThe main function of Store Pickup module is allowing customers to select a preferred store at checkout to arrive and pick up their ordered products. This section will show you how the extension works for customers. \n\n\n\n\nIn the \nShipping method\n tab at checkout, customers can select \nStore Pickup\n as their shipping option. Then customers can select a store from the dropdown list: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOr customers can select on Google map as bellow:\n\n\n\n\n \n\nOn the G-Map popup, customer needs to select a store on store list or search store that they want, after that click on the \nApply\n button to apply or click on \nClose\n button to cancel.\n\n\n\n\nAfter selecting a store, customers need to choose a specific shipping date and time for arrival, and then check out as usual by clicking on the \nContinue\n button.\n\n\n\n\nIf the shipping date is one of store\u2019s holidays, customers will get a message notifying them to choose another date. Thus, they can avoid arriving on the store\u2019s days off. You can refer to section \n\"Manage Holidays\"\n to know how to set up these holidays.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the \nPayment Information\n tab, applicable payment methods for \nIn-store Pickup\n are shown as your configuration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore placing order, customers can also review the store address, shipping date and time along with other order information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView Orders\n\n\nTo view their orders with store pickup information, customers can go to \nMy Account\n on Top-Link > \nMy Orders\n tab > \nView Order\n.\n\n\n\n\nTo print orders, customers can click on \nPrint Order\n on the top right.\n\n\nReceive Order Emails\n\n\nAfter placing orders, customers will receive the confirmation email with information about the pickup store.\n\n\n\n\nHOW TO CONFIGURE\n\n\nYou have seen how Store Pickup works in front-end for customers. The following part will guide you through how to configure and manage the module in back-end.\n\n\nNew release:\n* One of the most important Google Maps APIs Standard Plan updates implemented on June 22, 2016 was that \nrequired future product updates are only available for requests made with an API key.**\n\n\nhttps://developers.google.com/maps/faq#using-google-maps-apis\n\n\nThis means active domains created before June 22, 2016, continue to be able to access the Google Maps JavaScript API, Static Maps API, and Street View Image API without an API key. They are not affected by keyless access being unavailable for new domains. \n\n\nHowever, Google Maps APIs Standard Plan advise all developers to use a key in order to guarantee their quality of service. Applications that continue to make keyless requests may experience some periodic service degradation if other keyless applications' usage spikes and draws down the global unchanged quota.\n\n\nIn order to get API key, follow these steps as follows: \n\n\nStep 1\n: Visit APIs Console at \nhttps://console.developers.google.com/apis/library and log into your Google Account.  Then, click \nCreate project\n button on top of the menu. \n\n\n\n\nStep 2\n: Fill in the project name and click Create button\n\n\n\n\nStep 3\n: On the menu at the left side, you will see the \nCredentials T\nab. Click this tab and after that, a box will appear with \"\nAPI key\n\" on it. It is where you should click in order to create API key for your browser apps.\n\n\n\n\nAfter that you will see a box with a number of choices specifying which kind of key you would like to create. Choose \nBrowser key\n \n\n\n\n\nStep 4\n: Fill in your name and domain and then click create\n\n\n\n\nStep 5:\n Get the key and paste it in your page \n\n\n\n\nStep 6\n: Last but not least, in \nLibrary\n tab, let\u2019s enable the APIs in red frame as below \n\n\n\n\nManage Stores\n\n\nIn the back-end, go to \nStore Pickup\n \u2192 \nManage stores.\n The \nStore Manager\n grid shows all stores created in your system with their address and status. To add new stores, you can add them manually and import from CSV files.\n\n\n\n\nAdd Store\n\n\nClick on the \nAdd Store\n button on the top right corner of the \nStore Manager\n page. You will be navigated to the \nAdd Store\n page, which includes 3 tabs: \nGeneral Information\n, \nTime Schedule\n and \nCustomer Messages\n.\n\n \n\n\n\n\nGeneral Information\n tab: \nThis tab has 3 sessions: Store Information, Contact Information and Google Map. \n\n\n\n\n\u2713 Fill store\u2019s name, shipping fee, address and description in \nStore Information\n session. You can select tags if you want your customers can search this store by tags.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTips:\n* You can input content for the \nDescription** field in HTML for better display in frontend, such as customized format, attached links.\n\n\n\u2713 In \nContact Form\n session, it allows you to enter information of store\u2019s manager such as email address, phone number, etc. so customers will know how to contact if needed. You can configure to enable automatic emails sent to the store manager when pickup orders\u2019 status is changed.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\nYou can also upload store images to show on the \nStore Detailed\n page. The image chosen as Base Image is used on the \nStore Listing\n page as well.\n\n\n\u2713   \nGoogle Map\n session, you can fill in coordinates and set color of the store\u2019s pin shown on Google map, which is very helpful as you can highlight any store from others just with a different pin color.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime Schedule\n tab: \n\n \n\n\n\n\nWhen customers want to pick up products at a specific store, they need to know the suitable time to arrive. This tab helps you set store\u2019s opening time for that purpose. Let\u2019s take Monday for example:\n\n\n-If your store opens on Monday, choose Yes for Open.\n\n\n-If your store opens from 6 am to 11 am and 1pm to 22 pm, set \nOpening Time\n as 6:00, \nLunch break starts at\n 11:00, \nLunch break ends\n at 13:00 and \nClosing Time\n as 22:00.\n\n\n-When customers select their pickup time at checkout, you can set the interval between options, such as 30 minutes. Then the shipping time options shown in the dropdown box are 7:00, 7:30, 8:30, etc.\n\n\nSimilarly, you can set opening hours for each remaining day of the week. To quickly set up, click on the \nApply to other days\n button on the top right corner of the Monday section. Other days will have the same working time as Monday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomer Messages\n tab:\n\n\n\n\nWhen customers fill in the Contact Form on the Store Detailed page, all messages are saved in this tab allowing admin/ store manager to review later.\n\n\n\n\nAfter entering all required information, click on the \nSave Store\n or \nSave And Continue Edit\n buttons to create the store.\n\n\nImport Store\n\n\nClick on the \nImport Store\n button on the top right corner of the \nStore Manager\n page. You will be navigated to the \nImport File\n page.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCSV file structure\n\nYou can download the sample \u201cstores.csv\u201d file to view its structure. The columns are attribute values of the store and each row corresponds to one store. The title row (first row) contains the attribute name; you can note it (important!) because the system reads data from CSV files based on the name. If the attribute value of any stores is null, you don\u2019t have to fill data in to it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImport file\n\n\n\n\nCreate a CSV file with information of your store following the sample file structure\n\n\nClick on button \nChoose File\n to select  your  CSV file\n\n\nSelect \nSave Store\n to import the CSV file\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit Store\n\n\nOn the \nStore Manager\n grid, you click on any store to edit. Besides 3 tabs when you create a new store, you can see more \nRelated Orders\n tab.\n\n\n*Note:\n\n\nWhen a store is imported or created manually, the system will automatically get the coordinates based on the store address by using Google API. However, in some cases, this way may be not completely accurate. Therefore, the \nGoogle Map\n tab allows you to edit store coordinates manually.\n\n\nYou can see it at the left upper. Click on this tab, the Google map will be displayed. You can reset store position by clicking on any point on the map, and then select \nSave Store\n.\n\n\nWhen you edit the store address (street, city or state/province) in \nGeneral Information,\n the store coordinates will be auto-updated after being saved. You can also edit the color of store\u2019s pin shown on map and preview it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Orders\n tab:\n\n\n\n\nThis tab shows you all pickup orders of this store.\n\n\n\n\nManage Holidays\n\n\n \n\n\nTo set days off for your stores, go to \nStore Pickup\n \u2192 \nManage Holidays\n. You will be navigated to the \nHoliday Manager\n page listing all holidays created. Click on \nAdd Holiday\n button to create a new one.\n\n\n\n\nOn the \nAdd Holiday\n page:\n\n\n\n\nEnter the holiday name\n\n\nSelect store(s) to apply holiday from the list\n\n\nSelect the start date and end date of holiday\n-Fill a notification message in the \nComment\n field.

You will be navigated to the \nSpecial Day Manager\n page listing all special days created. Click on the \nAdd Special Day\n button to create a new one.  \n\n\n\n\nOn the \nAdd Special Day\n page:\n\n\n\n\nEnter special day name\n\n\nSelect store(s) to apply special working days from the list\n\n\nSelect the start date and end date of special days\n\n\nSet interval between shipping time options shown to customers at checkout, such as 15 minutes\n\n\nChoose opening and closing time applied to these special days\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember to click on the \nSave Item\n button to save your work. \n\n\nNote\n:\n Special days have the highest priority compared with holidays and other days.

The store still opens for pickup on that date but with special opening hours as you configured.\n\n\nManage Tags\n\n\n \n\n\nThis page shows the list of tags that you added.

They are not affected by keyless access being unavailable for new domains.   However, Google Maps APIs Standard Plan advise all developers to use a key in order to guarantee their quality of service. Applications that continue to make keyless requests may experience some periodic service degradation if other keyless applications' usage spikes and draws down the global unchanged quota.  In order to get API key, follow these steps as follows:   Step 1 : Visit APIs Console at \nhttps://console.developers.google.com/apis/library and log into your Google Account.  Then, click  Create project  button on top of the menu.    Step 2 : Fill in the project name and click Create button   Step 3 : On the menu at the left side, you will see the  Credentials T ab.

Sale staff can fill in card information manually or swipe card (if the POS system is connected with a card swiper). For more information about how to connect, please go to section \nHow to connect Web POS with peripheral devices\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSplit Payment\n: For more information about Split Payment, please go to section\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSplit Payment with Web POS\n\n\n\n\n2 Custom Payment option\n: You can change name of payment option as you desire, for example: change Web POS \u2013 Custom Payment 1 into Bank transfer.\n\n\n\n\nAfter choosing payment method, click on Place Order button to complete checkout process. There will be a notification as is shown below:\n\n\n\n\nSplit & Partial Payment with Web POS\n\n\nHow to make payment via Web POS using multiple methods (split payment)\n\nYou can use more than 1 payment method for split payments when checkout with Web POS. Let me give you an example.\n\n\nCustomer\u2019s order value is $606.04\n\n\n\n\nYour customer wants to pay $400 in Cash In. Then, you fill in the blank space \nCash In\n with the value of $400.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the remaining ($206.04), your customer wants to pay by Custom payment 1. So, at this time, you click on the \nAdd Payment\n button and choose \nCustom payment 1\n. The remaining amount ($206.04) will be automatically filled in the box.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n:\n\n\n\n\nSupport multiple payment methods for one order\n\n\nNot require Cash in method as compulsory\n\n\nYou can save payment method code to order if you do not use split payment (updated)\n\n\n\n\nProcess part of order payment (partial payment)\n\n\nWith Web POS, you can also apply partial payment that allows customers to pay part of the order value. For example, your customer wants to reserve the good before it will be launched. His order value is $606.04. He pays $300 as reservation.\n\n\n\n\nWhen processing payment, choose \nCash In\n with the value of $300. Then, instead of filling the remained values in other payment methods, you click on button \nMark as partial\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter finishing creating order, in the next step, when customers come back to pay the rest of order value, you open that order\u2019s details in \nOrder History\n tab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can check the total due is $306.04 and the total paid is $300. To complete the order payment, you click on \nTake payment\n button. Tick to choose the payment option or pay with multiple ones.\n\n\n\n\n\n-   After filling in the due amount, click on \nSubmit\n button to complete the payment action. Then the total paid is equal to the whole order\u2019s value.\n\n\nHow to keep orders on hold for further processing\n\n\nYour customers can't make up their minds yet, or are unable to make a payment meanwhile? They may want to purchase items that are for pre-order or currently out of stocks? You don't want to lose those potential customers, don't you? Then, Web POS's new feature can put these orders on hold - no limit in time - until they are ready to continue processing!\n\n\nAfter adding products to cart, you can choose \nHold\n to put the order into \nOn-hold Orders\n section. A \nNote for holding order\n will appear for inserting any comment that you would like to keep, for example, \u201cWaiting for payment\u201d.\n\n\n\n\nTo check orders that have been put on hold, select \nOn-hold Orders\n section. List of on-hold orders is recorded with certain note for each order. You may select \nContinue Processing\n whenever customer is willing to take final action for payment or you may \nCancel\n it if it is not effective anymore.\n\n\n\n\nHow to print receipt and email order information\n\n\nYou can print receipt or email order information right after creating an order. Remember that you must be online and have permission to do these actions.\n\n\n\n\nThe receipt will look like the screenshot below:\n\n\n\n\nAnd here is the email of order information:\n\n\n\n\nHow to review orders\n\n\n \n\nIn POS screen, you can review orders by choosing \nOrder History\n tab.

The code uses a sequence of vertical bars and spaces to represent numbers and other symbols. Barcode is a reliable method for cutting costs and saving time for business.\n\n\nBarcode management module from Magestore provides your business with a handful solution to generate barcode, print barcode label and scan barcode, all in one.\n\n\nHow it works\n\n\nBarcode Listing\n\n\nPath: \nInventory Management > Barcode Management > Barcode Listing\n\n\nBarcode listing\n is a view to display all barcodes of all products saved in Inventory Management. It contains Barcode, SKU, Supplier and Purchased Time.\n\n\nFrom this screen, admin can easily Import barcode or Generate Barcode with 2 buttons on the top right.\n\n\n\n\nAdmin can also view details of each product and barcode.\n\n\n\n\nFrom barcode detailed page, admin can configure barcode printing and print barcode directly. \n\n\nProduct information is shown including Image, name, price and its availability in each warehouse.\n\n\nGenerate barcode\n\n\nPath: \nInventory Management > Barcode Management > Generate Barcode\n\n\nMagestore's solution gives you 2 modes to generate barcode:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne barcode per product SKU\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiple barcode per product SKU\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis can be configured in \nBarcode Settings\n (Path: \nInventory Management > Barcode Management > Barcode Settings\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you set \nOne barcode per product SKU\n as \nYes\n, then the system will allow you to generate one barcode for one product SKU only.\n\n\n\n\nNow to generate barcode, you go to \nGenerate Barcodes\n tab. From here you can select the product that you want to generate barcode, fill in the \nSupplier\n (optional) then generate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you set \nOne barcode per product SKU\n as \nNo\n, then it opens up 2 options to generate barcode when you go to \nGenerate Barcodes\n tab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese 2 options are: \nGenerate barcode per item\n or \nGenerate barcode per purchase\n.\n\n\nGenerate barcode per item\n means each item will have its own identified barcode although they have the same SKU.\n\n\nGenerate barcode per purchase\n means items will be identified by the time it is purchased. Although you take 10 items with same SKU in one time purchasing from supplier, these 10 items will have the same barcode.

Gift Card product will be shipped as normal products.\n     \n\n     - If Customers want to get the notification email when their friend receives Gift Card, they need to tick the \nGet notification email when your friend receives Gift Card\n checkbox.\n     \n\n     - To preview how the Gift Card actually looks like when recipients receive, Customers can click on the Gift Card thumbnail image or the \nPreview Gift Card\n button. A popup of Gift Card interface will be shown as below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter Customers add a Gift Card to cart, they can go to shopping cart page to review the cart by clicking on the \ncart icon\n on top right corner, then choose \nView and edit cart\n. Customer can edit and update the quantity of the gift card right on the Add to cart popup. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n     - The details of Gift Card when Customers send the Gift Card to their friend\n\n\n\n\n\n     -  The details of Gift Card when Customers buy the Gift Card for themselves:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen Gift Cards products can be checked out as normal products. Customers will receive a Gift Card code if they buy for themselves. In case Customers purchase the Gift Card to send to their friends, the code will be delivered to their friends\u2019 email with the following form:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the Sender has ticked the checkbox \nGet notification email when your friend receives Gift Card\n, a notification will be sent to his email address immediately after the Gift Card is delivered to the friend\u2019s email as below:\n\n\n\n\nIf Customers purchase Gift Card for themselves, the notification email that they receive is as below:\n\n\n\n\nUse Gift Card as a discount method\n\n\nWhen Customers have Gift Card codes, they can use them as a discount coupon when ordering a product at the Checkout page:\n\n\n\n\nCustomers can choose to use Gift Cards and enter the amount of money as on\n\nShopping Cart\n page. Then click on \nAdd Gift Card\n button to apply.\n\n\n*Note\n: Gift Card codes cannot be used to purchase Gift Card products but they can be spent on shipping fee, depending on Admin\u201fs settings.\n\n\nHOW TO CONFIGURE\n\n\n*Important Note\n: If you use a different theme from the default theme of Magento, you need to move template, skin and layout files into your theme folder: \n-  app/design/frontend/base/default/....\n- skin/frontend/base/default/css/magestore/...\n\n\nSettings\n\n\nTo configure default configurations and settings of the module, please log in to \nbackend\n, and then choose \nGift Card\n menu\u2192 \nSetting\n.

Remember to tap \nSave\n button to save the customer information for the next checkout.\n\n- Fill in the information for Shipping Address such as Phone, Street, City, etc\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFill enough information of Billing Address such as Phone, Street, City, etc\n\n\n\n\nGuest Checkout\n\n\nWhen you use Guest Checkout, the default customer that you configure in backend will be used (Please hover to the section \n2.3.1 What is default customer & how to configure Default Guest Checkout\n to get more details). At checkout, all fields will be auto-filled with that default information.\n\n\n\n\nHow to add comments to an order\n\n\nWhen you need to add comments\n\n\nIn some special situations, to remember about your order, you can add comment to it so that you will easily check it later. The comments on order are used internally. \n\n\nHow to add comments\n\n\nClick on \nAdd Order Comment\n icon in the top right corner. In the \nOrder Comment\n box, type the content that reminds you of this order. Then, save it.\n\n\n\n\nHow to check order comment\n\n\n\n\nIn Retailer POS screen\n\n\n\n\nTo view comment of order, you can go to \nOrders\n tab in Retailer POS screen, choose an order then scroll down to see Comment History\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Magento backend\n\n\n\n\nGo to Sales > Orders > click on a specific order. In order details page, scroll down to \nComment History\n tab to check whether it has any notes or not. \n\n\n\n\nHow to process at checkout for a customer\n\n\nYou have been through steps to add products to cart and add customer, let\u2019s move to checkout process.\n\n- When products are added to cart, select \nCheckout\n button at the end of the cart page\n\n\n\n\nYou will be redirected to the next page with information of Shipping & Payment Method\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Shipping method tab:\n\n\n\n\nNeed to Ship: Turn on to add Shipping Address\n\n\nChoose Shipping method \n\n\nSelect Delivery date\n\n\nIn Payment method tab:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Retailer POS checkout, you can choose among payment methods that are applicable.

There will be a notification as below: \n\n\n\n\nSplit Payment with Retailer POS\n\n\nHow to make payment via Retailer POS using multiple methods\n\n\nYou can use more than 1 payment method for split payments when checkout with Retailer POS. Let me give you an example. \n\n\nCustomer\u2019s order value is $125.00\n\n-   Your customer wants to pay $25 in cash. Then, you fill in the blank space \nRetailer POS - Cash-in\n with the value of $25.\n\n-   For the remaining ($68.29), your customer wants to pay by Credit Card. So, at this time, you fill in the amount at the blank space next to \nRetailer POS \u2013 Credit Card\n. \n\n\nNotes\n: \n\n-   Support multiple payment methods for one order\n\n-   Not require Cash in method as compulsory\n\n\nHow to create multi-orders for different customers\n\n\nRetailer POS allows you to create multi-orders for different customers and keep orders open until customers end up transaction. That means you can open multiple orders to serve lots of different customers at the same time. For example someone is paying for something in your shop and they decide to go and get another product, so you can keep this order open while you still can carry on serving the next customer.\n\n\n\n\nYou may select \nContinue Processing\n whenever customer is willing to take final action for payment or you may \nCancel\n it if it is not effective anymore.\n\n\n\n\nHow to print receipt and email order information\n\n\nYou can print receipt or email order information right after creating an order. Remember that you must be online and have permission to do these actions. \n\n\n\n\nThe receipt will look like the screenshot below:\n\n\n\n\nHow to review orders\n\n\nIn POS screen, you can review orders by choosing \nOrders\n tab from sidebar. Here you can see the \norder list\n and \norder details\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrder status\n\n\n\n\nIn order list, the status of order is distinguished by color\n\n    -   Complete: Green\n\n    -   Processing: Blue\n\n    -   Pending: Orange\n\n    -   Canceled: Gray\n\n    -   Order searching\n\n\nTo quickly find an order to review, you can search it by Order ID or Customer\u2019s Name/Email\n\n\n\n\nHow to create shipment or issue refund for an order\n\n\nHow to create shipment\n\n\nThere are two ways to create shipment using Retailer POS: \nbefore placing an order\n and \nwhen reviewing order\n\n- Before placing an order\n\n\nBefore an order is created by clicking \nPlace Order\n, you can create shipment by turn it on as below:\n\n\n\n\nAfter verifying shipment method, the system will automatically load to Successful Order Page:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen reviewing an order\n\n\n\n\nAnother way is to go to \nOrders History\n tab in Retailer POS screen. Choose the order you want to create shipment, then click on \nShip\n button. \n\n\n\n\nThere will be a message shown to notify you that shipment is created successfully. Please note that to use this way, you need to have permission and be in online mode.\n\n- Partial Shipment\n\n\nIf you chose to enable Partial Shipment, a box of Items to Ship will appear when you tap \nShip\n in \nOrder\n tab. Enter the quantity of each product customers want to ship, select \nShip\n.\n\n\n\n\nHow to issue refund\n\n\nSome certain staffs have permission to issue refund by cash (which is set by admin in backend. See \nHow to differentiate access permissions of Retailer POS users\n for more details).\n\n\nTo issue refund, go to \nOrders\n tab in POS screen, you choose the order that is required to refund. Tap on \nRefund\n button in the end. \n\n\n\n\nA popup will display so that you can fill in the information before making refund. Tick \nReturn to stock\n if you want to return those items back to your stock.\n\n\n\n\nAfter that, you will get the message informing that credit memo is created successfully. Please make sure you have permission to issue refund.\n\n\nHow to run sales report: based on staff, location or payment method\n\n\nBased on Staff\n\n\nIn backend, go to \nSales > Report\n. To view reports by staff, please choose \nStaff Report\n\n\n\n\nThe report with information of \nPeriod, Staff, Sales Total\n will be show in the table as follows.

Want to export data? You can choose 1 of 2 options including csv or excel xml. \n\n\n\n\nHow to use Session Management\n\n\nWhat is Session Management\n\n\nSession Management is a place where records cash flow after each cashier\u2019s shift. You have frequent cash in/out beside normal order transactions like paying electrical bills, balancing cash amount in hand, etc? Retailer POS system records deposits and withdrawals from your working shift then compare them with actual cash amount (counted in notes) after cashier\u2019s shift ends up.\nYou can easily set up it in Back-end by going to \nSales > Web POS > Settings > Need to create session before working\n:\n\n\n\n\nHow to create a session\n\n\nAfter you choose \u201cYes\u201d in Back-end to require to open a session before working, the following pop-up will be shown as below:\n\n\n\n\nCashiers will carry out to open a new session before getting started their shift.

The question is how to keep Customers returning and buying in your store? We offer you a wonderful solution- that is Magento Reward Points Plus module. It is designed to maximize Customers engagement in your store by many useful features.\n\n\nWith Reward Points \u2013Standard Edition, your Customers can receive reward points when placing orders on your site. These points then can be converted to money for checkout at the rate configured by you. The System will show messages about the number of points Customers will earn and spend. Customers certainly feel more encouraged to purchase at your site when they can get some bonus for doing that!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to use\n\n\nHow to earn points\n\n\nWhen placing an order, Customers can earn points based on the rate set by admin.\n\n\nOur Standard edition makes sure that Customers are well aware of your reward point policy by showing messages on many pages. For example, on Product Detail pages, there will be a notification for Customers that says \u201cYou could receive some Points for purchasing this product\u201d.\n\n\n\n\nAlso, after clicking on the \nAdd to Cart\n button, on \nMini Cart\n, Customers will see another notification \u201c\nCheck out now to earn points\n\u201d.\n\n\n\n\nIf Customers have not logged in yet, a notification message \u201c\nLogin and checkout to earn points\n\u201d will be shown on mini cart:\n\n\n\n\nOn \nCheckout\n page, Customers can see exactly the number of points they earned from buying that product in the \nGrand Total\n box:\n\n\n\n\nIf Customers have not logged in yet, a notification message \u201c\nLogin and checkout to earn points\n\u201d will be shown on \nGrand Total\n box of checkout page:\n\n\n\n\nAfter placing an order successfully, Customers can check their point balance right next to the \nMy Account\n top link or can go directly to that link:\n\n\n\n\nHow to spend points\n\n\nOn \nShopping Cart\n and \nCheckout\n pages, to spend points, there are 3 ways for customers to modify points they want to spend:\n\n\n1)  Move the slide forwards or backwards to select the number of points they would like to spend.\n\n\n2)  Enter this number in the empty box \n\n\n3)  Tick the checkbox \n\u201cMaximize my discount with points\u201d\n to spend the maximum number of points\n\n\n\n\nOn the \nCheckout\n page, System shows a similar form for Customers to edit the number of points they want to spend for their orders:\n\n\n\n\nManage reward points\n\n\nCustomers can follow and manage their current points in 2 places:\n\n\nOn the one hand, they can view their current points on the top link as below:\n\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, they can go to \nMy Account > My Rewards\n to view more information.\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, this page can be divided into two parts: \nReward Information\n and \nRecent Transactions\n\n\nReward Information:\n In this part, Customers can view their current balances as well as description about earning/ spending point rates on your site.\n\n\nRecent Transactions:\n This part provides Customers with information on their transactions of reward points including ID, points, action, date and status.\n\n\nIf Customers want to see all transactions, they can click on the \nView all\n links or the \nPoint Transactions\n tab.\n\n\nBesides, in the \nSettings\n tab of the \nReward Points\n navigation, Customers can set up their \nReward Points Subscriptions\n.\n\n\n\n\nHow to configure\n\n\nManage earning rates\n\n\nGo to \nBackend > Reward Points > Earning Rates\n.

Magento Store Credit module for Magento 2 allows you to enhance the interaction with your Customers by many activities such as adding credit or refunding Customers by credit. \nCustomers can use the credit to make purchases on your store or even share with their friends. \nWith Magento Store Credit module for Magento 2, credit can be used as a convenient and time-saving payment method. Customers just need to recharge their credit accounts one time and then use for many future purchases.\n\n\nMagento Store Credit\n is one module in our \nOmnichannel solution\n for Magento retailers.\n\n\n\nHOW TO USE (Frontend)\n\n\nThis section will show you how Customers can make use of \nStore Credit module for Magento 2\n in Frontend.\n\n\nBuy Credit Product\n\n\nAfter Customers login to your website, they can access the Store Credit Products page in two ways:\n\n\n\u2022   \nOption 1\n: on the top navigation bar, click to \nBuy Store Credit\n \n\n\n\u2022   \nOption 2\n: click on the \nStore Credit\n on the left navigation of the \nAccount Dashboard\n page\n\n\nIn this second way, they will be navigated to the \nMy Credit\n page on which they just need to click on the \nBuy store credit\n button\n\n\n\n\nAfter that, the \nStore Credit\n page will be shown as follows:\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, this page lists all \nCredit Products\n of your website. There are three types of credit products for Customers to choose:\n\n\n\u2022   \nFixed Value\n: These credit products have fixed value. \n\n\n\n\n\u2022   \nDrop-down Values\n: With this type, Customers can select a specific value in the drop-down list.\n\n\n\n\n\u2022   \nRange of Values\n: With this type, Customers can choose a desired credit amount within the range configured by admin in backend. \n\n\n\n\nAfter selecting credit products they like, Customers can add them to cart and checkout normally.\n\n\n\n\nWhen the order is complete, our module will auto-add that credit amount to the Customer\u2019s credit balance.\nCustomers can also send Credits to their friends by ticking \nSend credit to friend\n checkbox and enter all the required fields:\n\n\n\n\n\u2022   \nRecipient name\n: the name of the recipient \n\n\n\u2022   \nRecipient email address\n: the email address of the recipient. The system will send an email to this address\n\n\n\u2022   \nCustom message\n: the message that recipient will receive\n\n\nWhen the order is completed, there will be two cases happening based on signup status of the recipient email address.\n\n\n\u2022   \nCase 1\n: if the recipient do not have an account in the system, an email as below will be sent \n\n\n\n\n\u2022   \nCase 2\n: if the recipient has already had an account in the system, the system will automatically add that credit amount to the Recipient\u2019s credit balance\n\n\n\n\nIn both cases, the sender always gets email notifications as below:\n\n\n\n\nManage Credit on My Credit page\n\n\nIn order to access the \nMy Credit\n page, Customers can click on the \nStore Credit\n tab on the left navigation.\n\n\nManage Credit Balance\n\n\nOn the \nMy Credit\n page, Customers can view information about their current credit balances and transaction history.\nIn the section \nTransaction History\n, our module shows Customers all of their credit transactions with a lot of information including \ndate, type, details, added/deducted value in transaction\n and \ncredit balance\n.\n\n\n\n\nSend Credit to Friends\n\n\nFirst, Customers should click on the \nSend Credit\n tab on the left navigation to go to the \nSend Credit to Friends\n page.\nThis page has 2 parts including \nSend Credit to Friends\n and \nCredit Code List\n.\n\n\n\n\n\u2022   \nSend Credit to Friends\n: allows Customers to send credit to their friends by filling in all required information\n\n\n\u2022   \nCredit Code List\n: shows all information about the credit codes that Customers sent to their friends including \ncode, recipient\u2019s email, amount, sent date\n and \nstatus of code\n. Credit codes are not displayed fully for security purpose. When Customers click on, they will be shown clearly.\n\n\n\n\nPlease note that our module allows you to configure whether to require your Customers to verify their credit sharing or not. We will consider the two cases separately.\n\n\n\n\n\n\na.  Case 1: Customers are not required to verify their credit sharing\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to send credit to friends, Customers should enter the recipient\u2019s email and credit amount in the text fields. Our module will check that email address and show notification to Customers.\n\n\n\u2022   \nIf the recipient\u2019s email has not been registered on the website\n: \n\n\n\n\nIn this case, our module will show a notification for the Customer that his friend will receive the credit code via that email. The Customer can enter a message and click on the \nSend\n button. After that, the sender\u2019s credit balance will be deducted immediately and an email will be auto-sent to the recipient\u2019s email address.\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, this email informs the recipient about the credit amount, message and a credit code which can be used to redeem credit to his balance.\nAt the same time, the sender can also see the sent credit code in the \nCredit Code List\n section as below:\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, Customers can follow the status of the credit codes they sent. While the recipient has not redeemed a credit code, Customers are allowed to cancel it by clicking on the \nCancel\n link in the \nAction\n column. After the cancellation, the recipient cannot redeem that credit code any more.\nOtherwise, once the credit code has been redeemed, the status will be updated and the \nCancel\n link will be disabled. Please refer to the section \nRedeem Credit\n for more information.\nCustomers can check their current balances and transactions of sharing credit in the \nTransaction History\n section.\n\n\n\n\n\u2022   \nIf the recipient\u2019s email has been registered on the website\n: \n\n\n\n\nIf the recipient\u2019s email address has been registered on your website, our module will send credit directly to his credit balance instead of sending credit code to his email.\nCustomers can check their current balances and transactions in the \nTransaction History\n section.\n\n\n\n\nAt the same time, recipients can get information about this transaction:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nb.  Case 2: Customers are required to verify their credit sharing\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you configure that Customers have to verify before sharing credit, after clicking on the \nSend\n button, they will receive an email as below:\n\n\n\n\nAt the same time, they will be navigated to the \nVerify\n page:\n\n\n\n\nOn this page, our module shows them a notification about the verification requirement. In the \nCredit Code List\n, that code is put under the \u201c\nAwaiting verification\n\u201d status with a Verify link. \n\n\nTo verify, Customers just enter the verification code they received in their emails and then click on the \nSubmit Code\n button.\n\n\nAfter Customers finish verifying, our module will send credit to the recipient.\n\n\nRedeem Credit\n\n\nIn order to go to the \nRedeem Credit\n page, Customers can click on the \nRedeem Credit\n tab on the left navigation.\n\n\n\n\nOn this page, Customers can redeem the credit code they received to their credit balance by entering the code in the text field before clicking on the \nRedeem\n button. Another way is just to click on the link in the email.\n\n\nAfter redeeming code, Customers can check their current balance and transaction in the \nTransaction History\n section.\n\n\n\n\nCheckout by Credit\n\n\nCustomers can use credit to checkout on both \nShopping Cart\n and \nCheckout page\n.\n\n\n\n\nOn the \nShopping Cart\n page, our module will add \nApply Credit Discount\n block for Customers to use their credit balances to checkout.\n\n\nTo use a credit amount, Customers can first enter that number in the field and then click on the \nApply\n button. Our module will auto-update and calculate the grand total of order.\n\n\nPlease note that Customers cannot use credit to buy credit products.

Thus, 72% of retailers start allowing Customers to purchase online before coming to a store and receive purchased products. If there is a chain of stores available, undoubtedly Customers will choose the nearest one as well as an appropriate time to arrive. How can the store-owner make that happen? The answer is Magento 2 Store Pickup extension \u2013 the most professional Magento shipping extension, which allows setting up multiple Magento stores, showing addresses and opening time of each store for the Customers\u2019 convenience.\n\n\nMagento Store Pickup\n is one module in our \nOmnichannel solution\n for Magento retailers.\n\n\n\nHow to use\n\n\nMany times customers want to visit your physical store to pick up products ordered so they can test the quality as well as save the shipping fee. Below, let us introduce you how customers exploit all the usefulness when your store is integrated with the \nStore Pickup\n module.\n\n\nView Store Information\n\n\nStore Pickup module creates a separated page to list all of your stores in the front-end. Customers can access this page by clicking on \narrow button\n on Top-Link (the top right of the page)\n\n\n\n\nThe Store Listing page includes 4 sections: \nStore list\n, \nSearch form\n, \nGoogle Map\n and \nTags list\n.\n\n\n\n\n\u2022   The list of all stores is shown on the bottom of Google Map. Customers can view store names and base images on this list. \n\n\n\u2022   Store locations are displayed on Google Map. Customers can zoom in/ zoom out and choose view mode as map/ satellite as preferred. Customers can also view store address or get direction by clicking on the pin icon of any store.\n\n\n\u2022   Switch the tab to search stores by distance or area.\n\n\n\u2022   Besides, customers can also filter by tags. Customers just have to click on tags they want to search. Then, list of stores which admin add these tags to will be shown.\n\n\nWhen customers click on a store on the map, they can instantly view the store location along with its name, address, phone number and store manager\u2019s email address. Customers can also get direction on this box.\n\n\n\n\nFor more details of a store, customers can click on its name link to be navigated to the detailed page.\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, this page shows all details that customers want to know about a store before arriving, such as location, contact info, working time, description and store images. \nThey can also view list of special days & holidays in \nSpecial day\n & \nHoliday information\n tab. They can conveniently give comment to stores by filling in the Facebook comment box:\n\n\n\n\nUse Store Pickup at Checkout\n\n\nThe main function of Store Pickup module is allowing customers to select a preferred store at checkout to arrive and pick up their ordered products. This section will show you how the module works for customers. \n\n\n\u2022   In the \nShipping method\n tab at checkout, customers can select \nStore Pickup\n as their shipping option. Then customers can select a store from the dropdown list: \n\n\n\n\nor select on Google map as bellow:\n\n\n\n\nOn the G-Map popup, customer needs to select a store on store list or search store that they want, after that click on the Apply button to apply or click on Close button to cancel.\n\n\n\u2022   After selecting a store, customers need to choose a specific shipping date and time for arrival, and then check out as usual by clicking on the Continue button.\n\n\nIf the shipping date is one of store\u2019s holidays, customers won\u2019t be able to choose that on the calendar. Thus, they can avoid arriving on the store\u2019s days off. You can refer to section 3.2 to know how to set up these holidays.\n\n\n\n\n\u2022   In the \nPayment Information\n tab, applicable payment methods for \nIn-store Pickup\n are shown as your configuration.\n\n\n\n\n\u2022   Before placing order, customers can also review the store address, shipping date and time along with other order information.\n\n\nView Orders\n\n\nTo view their orders with store pickup information, customers can go to \nMy Account\n on Top-Link > \nMy Orders\n tab > \nView Order\n.\n\n\n\n\nTo print orders, customers can click on \nPrint Order\n on the top right. The following page will be shown:\n\n\n\n\nHOW TO CONFIGURE\n\n\nYou have seen how Store Pickup works in front-end for customers. The following part will guide you through how to configure and manage the module in back-end.\n \n\nTips\n*: For quick instructions on where to set up each function and how to get Google Map API Key, you can go to the \nStores > Settings > Configuration > Magestore > Store Pickup\n. Under \nService API** section, click on the link for Google Map API Key Registration Guide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew release\n*:One of the most important Google Maps APIs Standard Plan updates implemented on June 22, 2016 was that \nrequired future product updates are only available for \nrequests made with an API key\n**.\n\n\nThis means active domains created before June 22, 2016, continue to be able to access the Google Maps JavaScript API, Static Maps API, and Street View Image API without an API key. They are not affected by keyless access being unavailable for new domains.\n\n\nHowever, Google Maps APIs Standard Plan advises all developers to use a key in order to guarantee their quality of service. Applications that continue to make keyless requests may experience some periodic service degradation if other keyless applications' usage spikes and draws down the global unchanged quota.\n\n\nIn order to get the API key, follow the steps listed \nhere\n. \n\n\nManage Stores\n\n\nIn the back-end, go to \nStore Pickup\n > \nManage Stores\n. The \nStore Manager\n grid shows all stores created in your system with their address and status. To add new stores, you can add them manually and import from CSV files.\n\n\n\n\nAdd Store\n\n\nClick on the \nAdd Store\n button on the top right corner of the \nStore Manager\n page.

However, in some cases, this way may be not completely accurate. Therefore, the \nGoogle Map Location\n tab allows you to edit store coordinates manually.\n\n\nYou can see it at the left upper. Click on this tab, the Google map will be displayed. You can reset store position by clicking on specific point on the map, then select \nSave Store\n.\n\n\nBy clicking \nApply to Form\n before saving, the store coordinates & the store address will be auto-updated regarding the address of the location you pinned on the map.

Moreover, you will get basic knowledge about how you can decentralize roles, users and staffs for your company.\n\n\nWith this guide, hope that you can transform your business into a true \nOmnichannel Retail\n easily. \n\n\n\n\nHOW TO INSTALL\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter purchasing a module, you will receive an email that includes the link to access \nMy License Certificates\n on MageStore website. If you don\u2019t receive the email, you can directly login to your account dashboard at MageStore then go to \nMy Account/My License Certificates\n. Here you will select your \nOrder number\n and a corresponding \nProduct\n then type the \nback-end domain of your live site\n. It is optional to add your Development Domains right or later. Click on the \nGenerate Certificate\n button to get your \nLicense Certificate.\n\n\nNote:\n \nLicense Certificate\n is a PDF document that contains your License Information including your Product Name, License Serial, License Type, Registered Domain, Expiration date, etc. Your \nLicense Serial\n is unique and can only be used once for one module. You can go to MageStore \nCheck License Information\n page, enter your License Serial to check your license status. You can also view your License Information in back-end when your module installation is finished.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo to \nMy Downloadable Products\n. Choose the version of the module then download it. The file that you download is normally a zip file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s required to enable cache in the administration panel of your site. Go to \nSystem/Cache Management\n. Choose all caches and click on \nEnable\n then submit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse FTP client (such as Filezilla, WinSCP, cuteFtp) to upload or copy all folders in the zip package to your Magento site root folder. This will not overwrite any existing file; just add new files to the folder structure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter uploading is done, log in your Magento administration panel to refresh cache. Go to \nSystem/Cache Management\n. Select all caches and take action \nRefresh\n then submit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigate to \nSystem/Configuration\n. If you can see the module tab, it is installed properly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow if you get access denied error when click on the module tab, you need to log out admin panel and log in again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo to front-end and try to process, make sure that everything is OK.\n\nNote:\n In the case that you have followed all above steps but couldn\u2019t make the module work properly, to make your website function as normal, you can delete the file or change the module\u2019s filename module in \napp/etc/magestore_module_name.xml\n (for example, change \nMagestore_Affiliateplus.xml\n to \nMagestore_Affiliateplus.xml.bka\n ).

They are not affected by keyless access being unavailable for new domains. \n\n\nHowever, Google Maps APIs Standard Plan advise all developers to use a key to guarantee their quality of service.

New release:  One of the most important Google Maps APIs Standard Plan updates implemented on June 22, 2016 was that required future product updates are only available for requests made with an API key.  This means active domains created before June 22, 2016, continue to be able to access the Google Maps JavaScript API, Static Maps API, and Street View Image API without an API key. They are not affected by keyless access being unavailable for new domains.   However, Google Maps APIs Standard Plan advise all developers to use a key to guarantee their quality of service. Applications that continue to make keyless requests may experience some periodic service degradation if other keyless applications' usage spikes and draws down the global unchanged quota.\nTo get API key, follow these steps as follows:   Step 1:  Visit APIs Console at https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library and log into your Google Account.  Then, click Create project button on top of the menu.    Step 2:  Fill in the project name and click Create button   Step 3:  On the menu at the left side, you will see the  Credentials  Tab.   Click this tab and after that, a box will appear with  API key  on it. It is where you should click to create API key for your browser apps.   After that you will see a box with number of choices specifying which kind of key you would like to create. Choose  Browser key     Step 4:  Fill in your name and domain and then click create   Step 5:  Get the key and paste it in your page    Step 6:  After all, in  Library  tab, enable the APIs in red frame as below",
