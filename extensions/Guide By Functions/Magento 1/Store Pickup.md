## INTRODUCTION

----------


According to ComScore, 61% of shoppers would rather use free in-store pickup than pay for shipping. Thus, 72% of retailers start allowing Customers to purchase online before coming to a store and receive purchased products. If there is a chain of stores available, undoubtedly Customers will choose the nearest one as well as an appropriate time to arrive. How can the store-owner make that happen? The answer is Magento Store Pickup module – the most professional Magento shipping module, which allows setting up multiple Magento stores, showing addresses and opening time of each store for the Customers’ convenience.

## HOW TO USE

### 	Use Store Pickup at Checkout

The main function of Store Pickup module is allowing customers to select a preferred store at checkout to arrive and pick up their ordered products. This section will show you how the extension works for customers. 

- In the **Shipping method** tab at checkout, customers can select ***Store Pickup*** as their shipping option. Then customers can select a store from the dropdown list: 

![enter image description here](https://github.com/Magestore/Docs/blob/master/extensions/Guide%20By%20Functions/Magento%201/image_Store%20Pickup/image011.png?raw=true)

![enter image description here](https://github.com/Magestore/Docs/blob/master/extensions/Guide%20By%20Functions/Magento%201/image_Store%20Pickup/image012.png?raw=true)

On the G-Map popup, customer needs to select a store on store list or search store that they want, after that click on the **Apply** button to apply or click on **Close** button to cancel.

- After selecting a store, customers need to choose a specific shipping date and time for arrival, and then check out as usual by clicking on the **Continue** button.
If the shipping date is one of store’s holidays, customers will get a message notifying them to choose another date. Thus, they can avoid arriving on the store’s days off. You can refer to section **"Manage Holidays"** to know how to set up these holidays.

## HOW TO CONFIGURE

You have seen how Store Pickup works in front-end for customers. The following part will guide you through how to configure and manage the module in back-end.

***New release:** One of the most important Google Maps APIs Standard Plan updates implemented on June 22, 2016 was that **required future product updates are only available for requests made with an API key.**
  
https://developers.google.com/maps/faq#using-google-maps-apis

This means active domains created before June 22, 2016, continue to be able to access the Google Maps JavaScript API, Static Maps API, and Street View Image API without an API key. They are not affected by keyless access being unavailable for new domains. 

However, Google Maps APIs Standard Plan advise all developers to use a key in order to guarantee their quality of service. Applications that continue to make keyless requests may experience some periodic service degradation if other keyless applications' usage spikes and draws down the global unchanged quota.

In order to get API key, follow these steps as follows: 

**Step 1**: Visit APIs Console at 
https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library and log into your Google Account.  Then, click **Create project** button on top of the menu. 

![enter image description here](https://github.com/Magestore/Docs/blob/master/extensions/Guide%20By%20Functions/Magento%201/image_Store%20Pickup/image018.png?raw=true)

**Step 2**: Fill in the project name and click Create button

![enter image description here](https://github.com/Magestore/Docs/blob/master/extensions/Guide%20By%20Functions/Magento%201/image_Store%20Pickup/image019.png?raw=true)

**Step 3**: On the menu at the left side, you will see the **Credentials T**ab. Click this tab and after that, a box will appear with "**API key**" on it. It is where you should click in order to create API key for your browser apps.

![enter image description here](https://github.com/Magestore/Docs/blob/master/extensions/Guide%20By%20Functions/Magento%201/image_Store%20Pickup/image020.png?raw=true)

After that you will see a box with a number of choices specifying which kind of key you would like to create. Choose **Browser key** 

![enter image description here](https://github.com/Magestore/Docs/blob/master/extensions/Guide%20By%20Functions/Magento%201/image_Store%20Pickup/image021.png?raw=true)

**Step 4**: Fill in your name and domain and then click create

![enter image description here](https://github.com/Magestore/Docs/blob/master/extensions/Guide%20By%20Functions/Magento%201/image_Store%20Pickup/image022.png?raw=true)

**Step 5:** Get the key and paste it in your page 

![enter image description here](https://github.com/Magestore/Docs/blob/master/extensions/Guide%20By%20Functions/Magento%201/image_Store%20Pickup/image023.png?raw=true)

![enter image description here](https://github.com/Magestore/Docs/blob/master/extensions/Guide%20By%20Functions/Magento%201/image_Store%20Pickup/image024.png?raw=true)

### Manage Stores

In the back-end, go to **Store Pickup** → **Manage stores.** The **Store Manager** grid shows all stores created in your system with their address and status. To add new stores, you can add them manually and import from CSV files.

![enter image description here](https://github.com/Magestore/Docs/blob/master/extensions/Guide%20By%20Functions/Magento%201/image_Store%20Pickup/image025.png?raw=true)

#### Add Store

Click on the **Add Store** button on the top right corner of the **Store Manager** page. You will be navigated to the **Add Store** page, which includes 3 tabs: ***General Information***, ***Time Schedule*** and ***Customer Messages***.

-	**General Information** tab: 
This tab has 3 sessions: Store Information, Contact Information and Google Map. 
	
✓Fill store’s name, shipping fee, address and description in **Store Information** session. You can select tags if you want your customers can search this store by tags.
	
![enter image description here](https://github.com/Magestore/Docs/blob/master/extensions/Guide%20By%20Functions/Magento%201/image_Store%20Pickup/image026.png?raw=true)

***Tips:** You can input content for the **Description** field in HTML for better display in frontend, such as customized format, attached links.

✓In **Contact Form** session, it allows you to enter information of store’s manager such as email address, phone number, etc. so customers will know how to contact if needed. You can configure to enable automatic emails sent to the store manager when pickup orders’ status is changed.

![enter image description here](https://github.com/Magestore/Docs/blob/master/extensions/Guide%20By%20Functions/Magento%201/image_Store%20Pickup/image027.png?raw=true)

You can also upload store images to show on the **Store Detailed** page. The image chosen as Base Image is used on the **Store Listing** page as well.

✓	**Google Map** session, you can fill in coordinates and set color of the store’s pin shown on Google map, which is very helpful as you can highlight any store from others just with a different pin color.

![enter image description here](https://github.com/Magestore/Docs/blob/master/extensions/Guide%20By%20Functions/Magento%201/image_Store%20Pickup/image028.png?raw=true)

- **Time Schedule** tab: 

When customers want to pick up products at a specific store, they need to know the suitable time to arrive. This tab helps you set store’s opening time for that purpose. Let’s take Monday for example:
-	If your store opens on Monday, choose Yes for Open.
-	If your store opens from 6 am to 11 am and 1pm to 22 pm, set **Opening Time** as 6:00, **Lunch break starts at** 11:00, **Lunch break ends** at 13:00 and **Closing Time** as 22:00.
-	When customers select their pickup time at checkout, you can set the interval between options, such as 30 minutes. Then the shipping time options shown in the dropdown box are 7:00, 7:30, 8:30, etc.

Similarly, you can set opening hours for each remaining day of the week. To quickly set up, click on the **Apply to other days** button on the top right corner of the Monday section. Other days will have the same working time as Monday.

![enter image description here](https://github.com/Magestore/Docs/blob/master/extensions/Guide%20By%20Functions/Magento%201/image_Store%20Pickup/image029.png?raw=true)

- **Customer Messages** tab:

When customers fill in the Contact Form on the Store Detailed page, all messages are saved in this tab allowing admin/ store manager to review later.

![enter image description here](https://github.com/Magestore/Docs/blob/master/extensions/Guide%20By%20Functions/Magento%201/image_Store%20Pickup/image030.png?raw=true)

After entering all required information, click on the **Save Store** or **Save And Continue Edit** buttons to create the store.

#### Import Store

Click on the **Import Store** button on the top right corner of the **Store Manager** page. You will be navigated to the **Import File** page.

- 	**CSV file structure**
You can download the sample “stores.csv” file to view its structure. The columns are attribute values of the store and each row corresponds to one store. The title row (first row) contains the attribute name; you can note it (important!) because the system reads data from CSV files based on the name. If the attribute value of any stores is null, you don’t have to fill data in to it.

-	**Import file**
	-	Create a CSV file with information of your store following the sample file structure
	-	Click on button **Choose File** to select  your  CSV file
	-	Select **Save Store** to import the CSV file

![enter image description here](https://github.com/Magestore/Docs/blob/master/extensions/Guide%20By%20Functions/Magento%201/image_Store%20Pickup/image031.png?raw=true)

#### Edit Store

On the **Store Manager** grid, you click on any store to edit. Besides 3 tabs when you create a new store, you can see more **Related Orders** tab.

***Note:**
When a store is imported or created manually, the system will automatically get the coordinates based on the store address by using Google API. However, in some cases, this way may be not completely accurate. Therefore, the **Google Map** tab allows you to edit store coordinates manually.

You can see it at the left upper. Click on this tab, the Google map will be displayed. You can reset store position by clicking on any point on the map, and then select **Save Store**.

When you edit the store address (street, city or state/province) in **General Information,** the store coordinates will be auto-updated after being saved. You can also edit the color of store’s pin shown on map and preview it.
