<h2 id="how-to-configure">How to configure</h2>
<p>Go to <strong>Settings</strong> and you are able to configure the Instock Management module as below:</p>
<p><img alt="configure instock management module" src="../image_IM%20Rebuilt/image001.png" /></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Link stocks in Warehouse to Front Store View</strong>: The Instock Management module allows synchronization between the warehouse and its Magento front store. This means when you edit information or product quantity of a warehouse, this information will automatically be updated in that warehouse’s front store and visible to customers.
After enabling this setting, you can link the warehouse to one or multiple store view in <strong>Warehouses &gt; General Information &gt; Magento Store View</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><img alt="choose front store view to link warehouse to" src="../image_IM%20Rebuilt/image001-1.png" /></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Adjust Stock by entering the change qty</strong>: </li>
<li>If this feature is enabled, when adjusting stock, you can enter the difference quantity and the system will calculate the final balance in warehouse.</li>
<li>If this feature is disabled, you need to enter the exact quantity of stock in warehouse and the system will recognize this figure as the latest available quantity of product. </li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2 id="how-to-use">How to Use</h2>
<h3 id="stock-listing">Stock Listing</h3>
<p>After installation, the system will automatically provide a Primary Warehouse. This Primary Warehouse cannot be deleted but can only be edited. All the existing products will be automatically synced from your website to this warehouse before you can assign to another warehouse. </p>
<p>This function consists of 3 tabs to help you manage your inventory successfully:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stock in Warehouse</strong>: provides an overview of stocks in all warehouses or in a specific warehouse</li>
<li><strong>Non-warehouse Products</strong>: lists out a newly-created product which has not been assigned to any warehouse</li>
<li><strong>Warehouses</strong>: allows you to view and edit details of your warehouses</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="stock-in-warehouse">Stock in Warehouse</h4>
<p>This tab provides an overview of stocks in all warehouses. Here you can view stock SKU, Name, Price, Qty in Warehouse(s), Qty to Ship, Available Qty, Products in Warehouse(s), Stock Movement and Product Status. </p>
<p>The module provides an in-depth control over your <strong>composite products</strong> (configurable, bundle and grouped products).  You can see 3 quantity types of each variation or component of the composite product in a specific warehouse. </p>
<p>For example, if you have a configurable product whose root SKU is Pwt007, you can see the quantities of each available size. If you sell products which often have different sizes and colors like clothing, this is an efficient way to control your inventory. </p>
<p><img alt="control configurable product with variable sizes" src="../image_IM%20Rebuilt/image002.png" /></p>
<p>Note that there are 3 types of quantity shown:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Qty in Warehouse(s)</strong>: total amount of products in physical warehouses;</li>
<li><strong>Qty to ship</strong>: the number of products which has been ordered and is ready to be shipped;</li>
<li><strong>Available Qty</strong>: the amount of products left in the virtual catalog which is available to sell.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that <strong>Qty in Warehouse(s) = Qty to Ship + Available Qty</strong></p>
<p>You can select a warehouse in the drop-down list and the stock details in that particular warehouse will be displayed. </p>
<p><img alt="select a warehouse" src="../image_IM%20Rebuilt/image003.png" /></p>
<p>Update the total quantity and Shelf Location easily on the Inventory grid in only 4 steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step 1</strong>: Select the product(s);</li>
<li><strong>Step 2</strong>: Input the new Qty in Warehouse(s) </li>
<li><strong>Step 3</strong>: Add Shelf Location (optional);</li>
<li><strong>Step 4</strong>: Click “<strong>Update Stock</strong>”.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="change stock quantity" src="../image_IM%20Rebuilt/image004.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Shelf Allocation</strong> is a useful information to find the product in the physical stock quickly, especially in fulfilling customer’s order.</p>
<h4 id="non-warehouse-products">Non-warehouse Products</h4>
<p>When a product is newly-created and has not been assigned to any warehouse yet, it will automatically be allocated in this Non-warehouse list. </p>
<p><img alt="transfer non-warehouse product to a warehouse" src="../image_IM%20Rebuilt/image007.png" /></p>
<ol>
<li>Select the product(s);</li>
<li>Choose <strong>Add to Warehouse</strong> from the drop-down list; select the destination warehouse and click <strong>Submit</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="warehouses">Warehouses</h4>
<p>The <strong>Warehouses</strong> page displays each warehouse’s details such as its ID, name, total SKUs and total product quantities in each warehouse, contact email/ tel./ address. </p>
