Permitted reproductions, in whole or in part, shall bear this notice.\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nDo you know that the average abandonment rate is over 66%? Many Customers abandon online shopping on the checkout page due to complicated process. Improve it now by using One Step Checkout extension! All Checkout information such as billing address, shipping and payment method will appear together for Customers to fill in/ correct information of any step any time.\n\n\n\n\nHow to use\n\n\nThis section will show you how Customers engage on the Checkout page when your website uses One Step Checkout extension. You will see many improvements that make it much faster and easier for Customers to complete placing order.\n\n\nOne Step Checkout page Overview\n\n\nIf you set enabling \nRedirect to checkout automatically after adding product to cart\n (see more in \nsession 3.1\n), whenever Customers choose product and click Add to cart, it will be automatically navigated to Checkout page.\n\n\n\n\nOtherwise, Customers have to select the cart icon in the top-right corner and click on \nGo to Checkout\n. Then, it will redirect to the Checkout page. Here they can see the difference between the Step-by-Step default Checkout page of Magento and One Step Checkout page.\n\n\n\n\nThe Step-by-Step checkout page is a page with 5 separate steps including \nBilling Address, Shipping Address, Shipping Method, Payment Method\n and \nOrder Review\n. Customers have to complete each step before going to the next one. On the One Step Checkout page, all steps appear simultaneously. \nCustomers can fill in/edit information of any steps any time.\n This improvement can save Customers 2-3 minutes for checkout.\n\n\nOrder Comment\n\n\nCustomers also can add additional comments to their orders on the Checkout page, such as special instructions or the color of wrapping paper.\n\n\n\n\nSign up for Newsletter\n\n\nYou can ask Customers to sign up for your newsletter during checkout by just enabling the checkbox \nSign Up for Our Newsletter\n. You can even set it checked by default. This method is an easy way to help you gain many more subscribers to maintain relationship later.\n\n\n\n\nTerms and Conditions\n\n\nTo avoid any arising dispute after Customers place order, make sure they fully understood and agreed to your Terms and Conditions. You\u2019d better require Customers to check the box \u201cI read and agree to Terms and Conditions\u201d. When Customers click on the \nTerms and Conditions\n link, a popup with detailed information will show.\n\n\n\n\nAfter filling in required information, Customers click on the Place order now button to finish. They will see a confirmation page like this.\n\n\n\n\nLogin/Sign up if required\n\n\nStore-owners may want to require Customers to log in or sign up before placing an order. If Customers already have an account, they can click on \nClick here to login or create a new account\n. A popup will be displayed. They just need to enter their email address and password then click on the \nLogin\n button.\n\n\n\n\nIf Customers forget their password, they can click on \nForgotten your password?\n Then enter their email address and click on the \nSend password\n button. The module will send a new password to their email address.\n\n\n\n\nIf Customers don\u2019t have an account in your site, they can create one right away by clicking \nCreate a new account\n, filling in the required information, then click \nRegister\n. The new account will be created before placing orders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is super convenient, right? Signup and Checkout at the same time help you manage Customers and Orders more easily without swaying conversion rate.\n\n\nBilling Address, Shipping Address\n\n\nIf Customers have already logged in, they can skip the \nShipping Address\n section as their information is automatically added. If Customers want to change shipping address, select \nNew Address\n and change the information.\n\n\n\n\nIn case of not logging in, they will see fields to fill in: First name, Last name, Address...as you configured in backend.\nAfter providing a shipping address, if Customers want to create bill to another address, they can unselect the box \nMy billing and shipping address are the same\n then fill information in the \nBilling Address\n section.\n\n\n\n\nIn both \nBilling Address\n and \nShipping Address\n sections, when Customers type some first characters of their address, the system will show matching results suggested by Google.\n\n\n\n\nCustomers just need to select a correct option and then, other fields such as \nCity, Country, Zip Code, State/Province\n will be automatically filled out.\n\n\n\n\nWhen there is any change in \nShipping Address\n and \nBilling Address\n sections, \nShipping Method, Payment Method\n and \nOrder Review\n will be updated right away without reloading the page. Why is this feature useful? Let us give an example. A Customer may consider between 2 shipping addresses. He can see right on the checkout page that for 1 address, shipping fee is cheaper and payment method can be Cash On Delivery, but with the other address, just money transfer and advanced payment are accepted.\n\n\n\n\nShipping Method, Payment Method\n\n\nAfter Customers choose or change \nShipping Method\n and \nPayment Method\n as preferred, the \nOrder Review\n section will be updated correspondingly.\n\n\n\n\nTime of Delivery\n\n\nTo bring the most convenience to your Customers, you can enable the \nDelivery time and date\n in backend. Then at checkout they can select when will be most suitable for them to receive items ordered.\n\n\n\n\nOrder Review\n\n\nThe \nOrder Review\n section shows all items ordering as well as product images. If Customers change their decision, they can edit quantity or remove products without going back to the Shopping Cart page. Any changes will be updated right at checkout.\n\n\n\n\nCoupon Code\n\n\nWith the default checkout of Magento, Customers only can apply coupon codes on the \nShopping Cart\n page. With One Step Checkout extension of Magestore, you can let Customers enter their coupon code right below \nOrder Review\n on the checkout page.\n\n\n\n\nAfter Customers apply coupon code, the \nEstimated Total\n will be updated as below:\n\n\n\n\nIf Customers do not want to use that coupon code anymore, they can click on the \nCancel\n button.\n\n\nGift Message\n\n\nMagestore\u2019s One Step Checkout supports gift purchasing effectively. Customers can add a gift message along with their order. They just need to enter the sender name, recipient and message into text fields.\n\n\n\n\nGift Wrap\n\n\nYou can provide gift-wrap service at checkout and configure its price. After Customers tick option \nGift Wrap\n, a gift-wrap fee will be added, and \nEstimated Total\n will be updated.\n\n\n\n\nHow to configure\n\n\nYou have viewed the features which Magestore One Step Checkout provides in frontend. This part will tell you how to enable all those features in backend.\nGo to \nOne Step Checkout > Settings\n.\nYou will be navigated to the \nOne Step Checkout Configuration\n page where you can set up, configure our module to get it to work as you wish.\n\n\nGeneral Configuration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo\n\n\nField\n\n\nIf you choose...\n\n\nResult will be\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nEnable One Step Checkout\n\n\nYes\n\n\nOne Step Checkout feature becomes active on the checkout page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nEnable billing to different address\n\n\nYes\n\n\nEnable the checkbox named \u201cMy billing and shipping address are the same\u201d.

There are 8 colors for you to select, including orange, green, black, blue, dark blue, pink, red and violet. If none of the default colors match your desire, you can select the Custom option and then customize your preferred one using the color picker table. With each store, you can select the color you want or use the default color.\nAfter selecting a color, you will see a preview of your checkout page with the color chosen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly, you can choose a default color for the \nPlace Order Now\n button or customize it.\n\n\n\n\nWhen you complete all settings, remember to click \nSave Config\n. Your checkout page in front-end will be displayed as your configurations:\n\n\n\n\nWow, when you come to this point, you have almost grasped all the main benefits of our One Step Checkout extension. Sometimes, just viewing is not enough to really understand and enjoy something. It could be greater if you have an ownership of it and make it work as you wish. So, why don\u2019t you take action right away to feel its amazing effects on your sales?\n\n\nField Position Management\n\n\nThis section lets you enable/disable and rearrange the positions of fields in \nBilling/Shipping Address\n sections.\nNote: \nFirst Name, Last Name\n and \nEmail Address\n are required in Magento 2 system. If you disable these fields, Customers cannot place order even if they fill in all information.\nYou can rearrange fields into 2 columns like \nFirst Name\n on the left and \nLast Name\n on the right and spare \nAddress\n a full column by choosing \nAddress\n + \nNull\n.\n\n\n\n\nBesides, this section allows you to configure multiple stores so that the position of fields displayed on the One Step Checkout page will change according to each store\u2019s settings.\nFor example, if you want Default and Second store to be shown differently, choose \nMain Store > Default/Second Store\n in the \nCurrent Configuration Scope\n box in the top-left corner. Then, rearrange the position as you want.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter you configure in backend, the Checkout page will be shown in frontend as below:\n* Default store:\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond store:\n\n\n\n\n\nRequired Field Management\n\n\nThis tab allows you to configure which fields must be filled in to complete an order. Choose \nYes\n for required fields and \nNo\n for optional fields. As in the \nField Position Management\n tab, three fields, including \nFirst Name, Last Name\n and \nEmail Address\n, are required by default.\n\n\nAuto-update Sections\n\n\nIn this tab, you can configure which sections will be automatically updated whenever Customers change their information.\n\n*Note:\n The Checkout page is loaded fast or slowly depending on these configurations. To maximize your website\u2019s loading speed, you should enable only triggering fields and updated sections that are necessary and disable the unneeded ones.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo\n\n\nField\n\n\nIf you choose...\n\n\nResult will be\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSections updated when changing in Address\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nAuto update Sections following changes in Address\n\n\nYes\n\n\nAuto-update sections \nShipping Method, Payment Method\n and/ or \nOrder Review\n when Customers change information in \nBilling/Shipping Address\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nAddress fields triggered updating Sections\n\n\nCountry, Postcode, State/region, City\n\n\nAuto-update chosen sections when Customers change information in the \nCountry, Postcode, State/region, City\n fields.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nReload Sections\n\n\nWhen all required fields are field\n\n\nReload chosen sections when Customers change information in all required fields above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nUpdate Shipping Method\n\n\nYes\n\n\nAuto-update the \nShipping Method\n section when Customers change information in triggering fields.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nUpdate Payment Method\n\n\nYes\n\n\nAuto-update the \nPayment Method\n section when Customers change information in triggering fields.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nUpdate Order Review\n\n\nYes\n\n\nAuto-update the \nOrder Review\n section when Customers change information in triggering fields.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSections updated when changing in Shipping Method\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\nUpdate Payment Method\n\n\nYes\n\n\nAuto-update the \nPayment Method\n section when Customers change information in \nShipping Method\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\nUpdate Order Review\n\n\nYes\n\n\nAuto-update the \nOrder Review\n section when Customers change information in \nShipping Method\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSections update when changing in Payment Method\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\nUpdate Order Review\n\n\nYes\n\n\nAuto-update the \nOrder Review\n section when Customers change information in \nPayment Method\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerms and Conditions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Terms and Conditions\n: Choose whether to show the \nTerms and Conditions\n popup on the One Step Checkout page or not.\n\n\nTerms and Conditions Title\n: Set a title for the \nTerms and Conditions\n popup.\n\n\nTerms and Conditions Content (HTML)\n: Enter your \nTerms and Conditions\n by using HTML code.\n\n\nEnable custom size\n: Choose whether to customize size of the \nTerms and Conditions\n popup or not.\n\n\nWidth\n: Set the width of the popup\n\n\nHeight\n: Set the height of the popup\n\n\n\n\nAdmin Order Notification\n\n\nAn important feature of One Step Checkout is to send email notifications to Admin when new orders are placed.
